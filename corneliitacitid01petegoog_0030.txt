ῙΗΕ QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DA TE. xvii

phrase euoenr's admodum. But it must be admitted that is a writer of
the age of, say, twenty-five were recounting a conversation to which he
had listened when about twenty, he would have been at least as likely to use
some such expression as paucos abtim anuos. Moreover‚ in introducing
two of the ‘dramatis personae,' Aper and Secundus, the author of the
Dialoguc refers to them as ‘celeberrima tum ingenia fori nostri '-an ex-
pression which would certainly seem to point to a longer interval than
is compatible with any theory of composition under Titus. We do not
know the date of the death either of Aper or of Secundus: and they may be
supposed, if not to have died shortly after 74, at least to have retired from
active work· But if their death or retirement had been so recent as it must
have been if the Dt‘alogue was written about the year 79, we should have
expected some reference to the fact: as it is, they are spoken of in
the past tense (cp. defuit, contemnebat, metuebat 2 ad fin.) in away that
seems to indicate that the writer is contemplating their career from
a rather more distant standpoint in time.

But while we may lengthen the interval which separated the date of com·
position from the historical occurrence on which the Dialogue is said to
be based, and so combat the arguments which have been founded on the
use of the phrase iuuenis admodum, we need not accept the view of those
who confidently declare that if the work was not written before the acces·
sion of Domitian it cannot have been written till after his decease. No
adequate explanation of the difference of style can be suggested on any

¹ theory which places the date of the Dialogue beside that of the Agricola
and the Germania: rather we mustestablish such an interval as will account
for the development of the peculiar Tacitean diction which has begim
to show itself, in its main features, in these later treatises. And it must
not be forgotten that the writer professes to be recording what took place

by the help of ‘memory and recollection' alone, memoria et recordatione ,

l. 14-a phrase which, hythe way, seems hardly compatible with even
reliance on notes taken at the time. It would have been impossible for
him to have achieved this feat after an interval of more than twenty
years, especially as he professes to narrate the discussion exactly as it
‚ took place-isdem . . . numeris, isdemque rationibus . . . servato ordine
disputationis (1. 19).

If the statement which Tacitus makes in the introduction to the
Agricola is, as we have seen, inadequate to prove that the Dialogue could
not possibly have been written under Domitian, is there any other argument
that would disprove a supposition which will otherwise account for many
of the conditione of the problem under investigationi Here we must
distinguish between the early principate of Domitian and the reign of
