vi PREFA GE. .

A flavour of antiquarian interest also attaches to the treatise „

in virtue of the story of its discovery in the middle of the
fifteenth century. Ι have attempted to do justice to this in part
of the chapter on the Manuscripts. ln my researches into the
history of the codex in the British Museum (Harl. 2639) Ι have
been greatly indebt ed to the help, always most ungrudgingly
given, of Mr. Geo. F. warner, Assistant Keeper of MSS.

For the critical apparatus, my chief obligat' ron is to the ι
collationof the MSS. given by Mrchaelrs rn hrs edrtron of 1868, ⁴

admirably supplemented as it has been m recent years by
Dr. F. Scheuer. In recording the various manuscript readings,
1 have generally proceeded on the principle of admitting what

are obvious errors only when they are instructive as bearing on
the vexed question of the inter-relationship of the codices.

Everything has been included that seemed necessary for the

’ critical study of the text. The corrupt and defective condition
. in which it has come down to us may be advanced as some
Ι justification for the acceptance of emendations proposed by

different critica as well as for the insertion of several of my own

conjectures, some of which have already appeared in the columns , l

of the Classical Review. The result is that the text will be found
to differ considerably from that of Halm.

For what is not new in the explanatory notes 1 have relied
· mainly on the excellent editions of Andresen, Peter, and Wolff.
The suggestive commentary with which Dr. C. john has enriched
his translation should also be mentioned. Ihave had occasion
to refer more than once to the second part of it, published as
recently as last year, and containing much valuable matter. It
is more difficult to describe the nature ol my obligations to the
large body of pamphlet literature that has accumulated round
’ the Dialogue: reference may be made, however, to the lists of
tractates given on pp. lxxxix-xci. Many of them areos little
substantial worth, but it may be of interest to give a complete
catalogue of everything that Ι have had actually at hand in pre·
paring this book. Afew articles and pamphlets which Ι have never
seen have been omitted, but I doubt if they will be missed.
