PREFACE

μομ-

Tffls book may be regarded as a companion volume to the

edition oi the Teuth Book ol Quintilian’s Institutio which was
published in the autumnos 1891. The one has led to the other:
indeed it was while preparing the Quintilian that it occurred to
me to take the Dialogus also in hand. The motive was the
same in both cases—a wish to d0 something to remove from the
scholarship ol this country the reproach oi neglecting two ol the
most interesting specimens of Latin literature, or of relying
lor a knowledge ol them almost entirely on foreign sources.

Ι The reader to whom the Dialogus de Oratoribus is a new work
will find much in its character, contente, and history to account
for the extent ol space ¹which I have claimed from my indul-
gent publishers for its adequate treatment. Scholars know
that it is brimlul oi problems, though an exhaustive discussion
ol these problems, such as I have endeavoured to give in the
Introduction, has hitherto been conspicuously absent from the
achievements oi Latinists at home. For students, again, the
treatise is ol the utmost value, as supplying a field lor the
exercise oi many of the qualities-such as sense os style, literary
judgment and critical ability—without which aknowledge os Latin
will osten prove only a barren possession. In this connection,
I may quote the words in which Classen says there will be
general agreement: ‘dass der Dialog in seinem massigen Umiang
ungemein reichen Stoff zu den anziehendsten Discussionen der
verschiedensten Art darbietet3 und dieseEigenschait eben ist es,
die ihn nach meiner Ansicht ganz besonders zur gemeinsamen
Lecture mit reifem Schtilern, die wir zu selbststandigen Nach-
denken und umsichtigem Urtheil anzuleiten wlinschen, geeignet
macht.’
