THE INTERLOCUTORS AND THEIR PARTS. xxxiii

who is conscious oi what he owes to his art. He had come up to Romeg
from a Gaulish province as a nevus tremo, and had risen by the force of
his eloquence to high office. The approval of his audience, the gratitudo
of clients, the favour of the great, are to him the things chiefly worth
, striving for: why a man who could command all these should elect to be
a poet rather than an orator passes his comprehension. As a stylist, he
is the representative of the tendencies oi which Quintilian expresses
his disapproval. There is a certain striving after effect, which seems to ’
indicate an exaltatiohos sonu over substance ; and in the ‘ nominis contro-
versia' with which he introduces his disparagement of the ‘antiqui’ (16, 17)
we recognize the sophistis habit of debate, by which he might have stolen
a march upon a more unwary audience. Aper is all sor piquancy and

point: colores sententiarum, lumina orationis, ni‘tor et cultus descriptionum,

' —these were evidently as much to him as they were to Seneca himself.

Even Cicero he appraises hy this standard, and finds him just tolerable.
It was in his more mature years that Cicer0, according to Aper, began
to discover what true style r'eally was: locor queque leete'nrcr attemptavit
et quasdam sententies terminalique in iis orationibus quas semin iarn
et iaxta finem ne'tac composuit, id est, postquam usuque ct experimentis
misceat quotoptimum di'ccndi genus esset, 22. 7. His earlier speeches
are not free from the faults osa former age: he is slow and tedious,
wanting in passion, and destitute of what Aper and his friends valued
most, showy passages, epigrams, and ‘ quotable bits’ ε pauci sensus apte
etcum quodem lumine terminentur: nihil excerpere, nihil referre possc‘s, ct
velutin rudi artificio firmus sane paries et duraturus sednon satis expolitur
resplendens, l.c. His own position he defines inawelllmown sentence which
occurs in the same context: ege autem oratorem, sicut locupletem ac lantrem
patrem similene, non co tantum eolo tecto tegi quod imbrem ac eentum arceat,
sedetiam qnod verum et oculos delectet, non ea selum instrui supellectile quae
necessarri's usibus nefficiat, sed esse in apparatu cius et aurum ct gemmas, nt
sumere in manus et aspicere caepim lc'beat. lt is somewhat surprising that
so eminent a representative of contemporary tendencies as Aper evidently

, was should nowhere be even alluded to by Quintilian. We may infer

that, if he was still alive when Tacitus wrote, he had at least withdrawn
from practice at the bar (eptam ... contemnebat... nesciebat, ch. 2),
and that he died without leaving behind him anything fit to enter into the

prevailing taste no longer required an what was prieed hythe adherents of the
orator to give proof of possessing that new school, and it was with the idea of
wide culture that was the boast of the gaining increased prestige in regard to it
Ciceronian era (82. 10: cp. 19 sqq.). that he affected to look down on learning
His main interest was in the formal and and culture (e. g. philosophy 31. 25) as
technical aspect of his art. That was ‘extraneousaccomplishments.’
