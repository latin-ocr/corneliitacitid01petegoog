licen times by dwelling on the regrettable conditions on which it had
thriven. His whole attitude is one of reconciliation. He can venture
to be severe on persons of such doubtful antecedents as Crispus and
Marcellus (13. ιι), and he claims for himself the same freedom of speech
as he would allow to others (27.1a): but he is sensihle also of the
advantages which settled order and good govemment have secured for
the state (38 ad rin), even though the introduction of the new
regine had not at once involved the downfall of those who, like Crispus
and Marcellus, had made themselves indispensable to former and more
unworthy rulers His frequent references to the contracted sphere in
which oratory was now confined are made as an additional justification
of his personal attitude. He is forsaking a profession which had become
irhsome to him² (remotum . . . necessetate cottilie alz'quid contra animum
souindi, 13. ιγ), and which can no longer be what it was once: mehor
