margin os the Parisienris at the place indicated by Pithon. But the
author ol the note was not the copyist of that late manuscript, but the
scholar who wrote the Horarum, where it will be found in the rubric,
f. ²3 v. The same is true ol the marginal direction at eh. 9 appeteres

the end os the same chapter ¹.

Though it is impossible to say how the MS. now in the British
Museum carne into the hands of Ambrosc Bonwiclre, we are fortunately
able todetermine the name oi its first owner, and consequently its
approximate date. On the first folio of the Suetonius fragment appears
a coat oi arms which Mr. Wamer succeeded in identiiying as those os
John Tiptoft, the literary Earl of Worcester (d 1470). Tiptolt acted as
ambassador to the Pope and Council os Mantua in 1459, and returned
to England towards the end oi 1460, alter using the opportunity afforded
by his residence in Italy to get together a valuable libraryt In Florenee
he was taken in hand by the hookseller Vespasiano³, and attended
incognito a lecture by the renowned Argyropulos. This would he about
the time when Enoch's discovery had brought the Dzhloguc and the
Suetonius fragment, as well as the Germania, to Florence, and when
scholars were busy in emending a text that was admittedly corrupt.
What more natural than that the English collector should have wished
to secure a copy in which, however, the first two treatises were alone
included, owing to the similarity ol their subject matter? The upper limit

for the date of Tiptolt’s acquisition of the copy in question is fixed by the
time ol his sojourn in Italy: the lower limitis determined by the date of
his execution, October 18, 1470, aner which his arms would not have
been added to the codex& Another laetor in the calculation is the
