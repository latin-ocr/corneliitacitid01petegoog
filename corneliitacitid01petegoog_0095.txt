lxxxii INTRODUCTION.

evidence, both external and internal is against such a theory. The
probable character of the sequel of Messalla's speech, and of what must
have preceded ch. ³6 in the archetype has already been discussed¹. As
regards the extemal evidence, there is a pretty general agreement among
the MSS. that the lacuna under consideration extended to six folios
of the archetype, which had evidently been lost before the first copy was

taken from Enoch's find². The proportion of the lost part to the whole ,
’ has been variously calculated. Urlichs (Eos, ii. p. aga) thought it must

have been one-tenth; Brotier, who undertook to supply what was wanting
in a ‘Supplementum' took it at one-sixth,· Habbe³ has calculated it at
one-seventh, arguing that the ‘sex pagelle' of the MSS. must referto the

folios of the original ‘archetypum Fuldense,' from which what is known ,
nov as the First Medicean is believed to have been copied. A constituent r

part of this last-named MS, though separated from it now, is the Medicean
codex of Pliny's Letters, and Habbe believes that a comparison of a mar-
ginal note in the Vatican codex of Pliny (3864), which states the extent
of the lacuna in the sixteenth letter of the first book as ‘duae chartae,'
will give the result as above calculated for the Drblogue. In the Har·
lerlrnur, the copyist has carefully calculated the extent of the lacuna in the
codex which lay before him, and has left blank a space corresponding to
about one-ninth of the whole, no doubt in the hope that the missing part
would one day turn up, when it could be incorporated with the rest.

In discussing the question whether the manuscripts of the X family, or
those which derive from Y, are the more to be dependcd on for a scientific

reconstitution of the text, careful note must be taken of their distin· ,

guishing characteristica There can be no doubt that the copyist of Y
had a better knowledge of Latin than the copyist of X, and was also more
skilled in the solution of the various compendia which must bave abounded
in the archetype. Moreover, he was not content to follow his original
to the very letter, especially where he thought be could improve on it:
hence the MSS. which derive from Y show traces of a process of emenda-
tion which had begun, in all probability, with the writer of Y himself.
