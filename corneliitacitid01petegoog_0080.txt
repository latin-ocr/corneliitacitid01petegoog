MANUSCRIPTS. lxvii

It has already been indicated as probable that what Enoch brought to
Italy was no mere copy—though his instructions from Pope Nicholas had
originally been to take copies only-but the Hersfeld codex itself. Roth
bas stated the arguments in favour of this theory from the point of view
of the Suetonius fragment (see his Suetonius, pp. lxv sq.). Reifferscheid,
on the other hand (p. 411), argues that, while it may even have been the
ancient archetype of Fulda that Enoch found, our codices are not derived '
from it, but from a copy made by Enoch himself or by a contemporary.
The double readings so scrupulously recorded in some manuscripts he
thinks are a sign of the difficulty with which the ancient manuscript
was deciphered. They sometimes, indeed, diverge so widely as to
suggest the possibility of the supposition that another codex may have
been discovered, which was afterwards used to compare and correct the
copies made from the one Enoch found ; but any such theory is vetoed
by the occurrence of the lacuna at the end of ch. 35 of the Dialogus ¹,
which is found in every extant manuscript, and must therefore have
existed in the one and only original from which all are derived. Against
Reifferscheid's theory it may be urged that the compendia which would
have been used by a fifteenth-century copyist, such as Enoch or a con-
temporary, in transcribing an ancient MS. like the Fulda archetype,
would not have been so liable to be misunderstood as those in the
(supposed) thirteenth·century copy made at Hersfeld. And a note which
I have to report from Harlevunus ²⁶39 (H), a manuscript which will be
described below, seems to point in the direction of the belief that Enoch
brought more than a mere copy with him to Italy. At the end of the
Suetonius fragment the copyist of H has written in the margin these
words: Hic antiquissimum exemplar finit et hoc mtegram valletur. Unless
it is to be taken as amere statement of what he had been given to
understand was the case, this note, occurring in a manuscript which was
undoubtedly written within a few years of Enoch’s discovery ², must be
regarded as evidence that the copyist of H had access to the original codex
and was not merely transcribing from an almost contemporary copy.

All the existing manuscripts of the Dialogus derive, as has been already
stated, from the codex which Enoch found. They arc divided into two
families, at the head of each of which is supposed to stand a lost copy
of Enoch's codex, called respectively X and Y by Michaelis, N and M by ·
Baehrens. All the available evidence goes to show that the copy X was
made bya careful but unlearned scribe, and must therefore have been
