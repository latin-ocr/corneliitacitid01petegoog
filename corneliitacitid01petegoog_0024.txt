THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DATE. xi

concludes, therefore, that the Dialogue was written, at the soonest,
immediately after the close of Domitian’s reign, that is to say at a time
when we find, in the Germania and the Agricola, the historical style of
Tacitus already developed in its main features. We are thuS, according
to him, on the horus of a dilemma, and must either attribute the author·
ship of the treatise to some cultured contemporary, or else adopt the
theory (for which no adequate support can be adduced either from
psychology or from the history of literature) that it is possible for the
same writer to employ at one and the same time the most diverse styles
Such are the grounds on which, even in his third edition (1891), Andresen
falls back on the Non liquet of Lipsius: ‘somit erscheint die Frage der ¹
Autorschaft unserer Schrift noch heute ungelbst! ’

The fullest recent statement, in convenient form, of the gist of the whole
controversy is to be found in the work of Jansen‚ de Tacz'to Dialogt'
Auctore, Groningen, 1878. Jansen first undertakes to consider whether,
in order to prove the authorship of Tacitus, it is necessary to hold that
the Dialogue was the work of the historian's youth. This done, he
proceeds to show that the treatise must have actually appeared while he η
was still a young man, and that there is nothing chronologically impossible
in such a‘ supposition. Next he reviews the internal evidence in favour
,of the Tacitean tradition, devoting his concluding chapter to an
examination of the style of the treatise. To him it appears to be not so
unlike that of the historian as that the difference cannot be explained by
the interval of time and other considerations, while it is marked by many
features peculiarly Tacitean.

The mere narrative of such a controversy as this, with all the various
fluctuatione of opinion even up to quite recent years, might very well
induce in the mind of any reader unfamiliar with the text of the Dialogue
a condition of suspended judgment. The question has been thoroughly
discussed since the days of Lipsius, and it is doubtful if any fresh light
will ever be thrown on it. lt must be settled in accordance with the
evidence now before ue, after a careful and repeated study of the text
itself. But in all such literary problems, as notably the authorship and
composition of the Homeric poenis, the verdict arrived at by individuale
generally varies with the mental habit and pre-suppositions, not to say
prejudices‚ of each. It is commonly, in fact, a subjective verdict. Finality
is rarely attained, aud is perhaps hardly attainable. Yet, in this matter
of the authorship of the Dialogue, there seem to be data enough, in spite
of difficulties which need not be ignored, for a pretty confident acceptance
of the traditional view. It is of course unfair to call on those who dis-
