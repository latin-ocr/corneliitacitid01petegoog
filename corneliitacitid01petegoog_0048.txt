THE INTERLOCUTORS ΛΝΒ THEIR PARTS. xxxv

have been the more or less recent death ol all the interlocutors that
induced Tacitus to bring them together on his canvas.

Julius Secundus was a friend and contemporary of Quintilian, who
refers tobim more than once in complimentary terms ². From rr. 1, 121
we gather that hc died prematurely (riclerceptas), possibly about the
year 80 nn? One characteristic oi his style seems to have been
a certain wantos spontaneity: this is indicated in the allusion made
in ch. 1 to the criticism passed ou him by his detractors (quamvis moligm
plm'qrae opraarentur nec Secundo promptum esse sermonem et, dcc), as
well as in Quintilian’s phrase, definitae curae, quoted below. In the
Dzhlogue, as we have it now, he does not play the part that might have
been expected of him from the prominent way in which he is introduced,
along with Aper, in the second chapter. His prudent rescrve and retlring
disposition are shown in his question to Maternus about a ‘safer’ edition
(secunbrem) ol that poet's ‘Cato,' and in the way in which he deprecates
the proposal that he should act as arbiter between Maternus and Aper
(ch. 4). Some critics have held that he altogether declines this proposal,
r and ask where he makes his swerd, as there is not even a mention of
him in the closing chapter. But it should not be forgotten that it is
only as regards the difference between Maternus and Aper (as to the
comparative worth of poetry and eloquence) that his arbitration is pro·
posed; and, though the entrance of Messalla in ch. 14 gives a new turn
to the debate, Secundus first summarizes the rival speeehes, of which the
introductory part consiste, in an impartial deliverance, in which he shows
due appreciation of the sermo of Aper on the one hand, and the oratio
of Maternus on the other (14. 6). It is more difficult to decide whether¹
a speech os Secundus may not have been lost in the great lacuna which
follows ch. ³5. On the whole, it appears probable that whether or
not Secundus contributed a set speech, expressing his individual attitude,
beat least played a larger part in the debate than would appear irom
the textas we have it now. Τοο much weight need not be attached to
what Maternus says (16. 8), when he undertakes, on behalf ol Sebundus
as well as for himself, to supply what Messalla may omit in his presenta-
tion ol the question under discussion. But, a prz'o‘ri, it seems improbable
that Secundus would have been so prominently introduced along with
Aper in the opening chapter, ilhis admiring pupil had only intended to
use him sor a few appropriate utterances to mark the development ol
