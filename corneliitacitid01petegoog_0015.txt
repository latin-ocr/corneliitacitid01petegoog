¹ course of study. For this reason—especially in view ol the comparative

poverty ol Latin literature in such worlrs-the Dialogue might have been
expected to win a place sor itsell in the curriculum of our higher schools
and Universities. Its substance is as valuable as its form is interesting
and attractive. It introduces us to a distinguished circle os public men
at Rome, who are represented as taking advantage of a more or less
accidental gathering to discuss questions ol great interest and importance
sor us as well as lor themselves. Meeting together in the calm repose
which had resulted from the political settlement recently effected by the
founder of the Flavian dynasty, they bring under review past and present
circumstances in their bearing upon the profession in which they have all
more or less a common interest, the profession of oratory,—exchanging
opinions as to the merit and lame of the great orators ol republican times
as well as the divergent tendencies of the spirit os their own day, comparing
the main features of previous and contemporary methods of education,

' and endeavoun'ng to estimate the influence of political conditione on

the growth and prosperity ol the art with which they are all connected.
All this gives the Dialogue a value of its own, independently of other

accustomed to associate with the literature ol the epoch ol which it is so
charming a survival.

Tacitus was the author ol such a treatise as the Drizlogue, there would
have been less ground for the scepticism which has so persistently pre·
vailed in regard to it, almost since the date ol its rediscovery. But there

seems to have been none. The Humanists of the Renaissance searched ·

for many ancient writings which, though lurking concealed in neglected
corners, they knew must somewhere exist; and in their search they
stumbled upon others of which even the memory had passed away. One
of these was the Dialogue, which had corne down to them through the
unbroken quiet ol the centuries without any literary notice to put thern on
its tradi, a monks' treasure in regard to which one might almost imagine
there had been a conspiracy of silence.

It might have been expected that awork which had escaped the notice
ol previous ages, and which, in the one and only manuscript to which we
