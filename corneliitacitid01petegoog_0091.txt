lxxviii INTRODUCTION.

appearance on the last lolio, in a different hand, oi two couplets on the
death of a dog, as follow :-

Parva rebor tibi parva domus es corpore parvus
Et brevis est tumulus et breve carmen habe.
Mapheus Vegetus.

Furutn moeror heri spes quondam gone (1) catelle
llic nunc spes furum moeror herique iaces.

L. A. 1462.

Malieo Vegio we know as ‘the single instance of a poet-philologer who
assumed the cowl' (Symonds, Renaissa'ncc, p. 517; Voigt‚ ii. p. 375).
Greater interest attaches to the identification os the initials attached to
the second couplet. It seems probable that they are those os the well-
known Leon Battista Alberti, one os the most remarkable figures in the
age oi the Renaissan'ce and a man ol the most varied accomplishments.
Alberti is known to have had a favourite dog, and on its death he
celebrated its praises in a piece ol Latin entitled ‘Leonis Baptistae
Alberti canis¹.’ The occurrence ol the couplet is os course no proof
that the volume belonged to Alberti: the initials may merely reler to him
as the author ol the couplet, and the date may give the year in which he
composed it. At the same time, as both epitaphs are in a different
hand from that of the copyist, it is probahle that they were added in
1462 to a manuscript that had been written a few years previously. The
writer may have intended them as a memorial ol Tiptolt's relationship
with Alberti, and ol the interest he had taken in the dog which was thus
commemorated. The modesty ol tlre initials L. Α., alongside oi Vegio's
lull name, might suggest an autograph: Alberti, aller meeting Tiptolt in
Rome or elsewhere, may have sent the codex after him to England‚ with
the couplets attached ¹. He is known to have been in correspondence
with Enoch oi Ascoli in 1451 (see Pozzetti, L. B. Altera· laudatus, 178p,
p. 15), and he probably kept himself informed of the results of the
monk’s search lor manuscripts. On the other hand, supposing that
Tiptolt had ordered the codex belore leaving Italy in 1460, the interval
ol two years seems unnecessarily long.

Reference has been made already to another interesting leature in the
