and Head Master of Merchant Taylors from 1686 till he was dismissed
in 1691 for not having taken the oath of allegiance ¹. The MS. was
bought along with six others, for the sum of aq nn, from W. Bowyer,
the printer, who acted as Bonwiclce’s executor after his death on Oct. ao,
17²²· The date of the transaction is recorded as Sept. 11, 1725 ².

The Horlohnus (H) is mentioned by Roth in his edition of Suetonius
(p. lxi), and Michaelis derived his account of it from him. Baehrens also
refers to it in his critical commentary, but only to deny it any authority.
He ranks it after the Parisiensis 7773 and the Vindobonerm's (V2), and
describes all three as ‘of very recent date and vilely interpolated ’—libri
quitiam recentriszinisocdzisimeque interpolati (p. 45). I shall be able to
show, however, that the Horterhnus takes us back to within a few years of
Enoch's discovery, and that the Porth'ensis, which was used byPithou and
included by Michaelis among the MSS. on which he founded his critical
edition (1868), was directly copied frorn it at a date considerably later.
The Porisiensis need not be referred to again in any discussion of the
textos the Dialogue. It has not, and ought never to have been allowed,
any independent value whatever. Perhaps the clearest proof that it is
amere copy of H may be found in the fact that at 40.9 it omits the
words [libertatem vocabant comes seditionum effrenata} These words form
a single line in H, and were inadvertently passed over by the copyist.
The late date of the Parisiensis is indicated by what Pithou says in his
Paris edition (1580): in hutics autem dialogi editione, praeter exemplar in
Italrir ante aliquot annos descriptum, maxtino nobas adrianento snr'tLipsii
nostri industrio, tre. In his commentary on 15. a he reports a marginal
note Eadem uerba sunt Petroni: ‘in exemplari Italico ad h. l. adscriptum
fuit Eadem uerba sunt Petroni et sane quaedam initio Satyrici Petroniani
quae huius disputationis aliquot locis valde consentanea sunt! This
enabled Egger³ to identify the Porisiensis as the codex used by Pithon,
and thus to solve a question to which he alludes as ‘lis a viris doctis
agitata': he found traces of the words codem verbu sunt Petrom'i in the
