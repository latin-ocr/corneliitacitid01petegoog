THE INTERLOCUTORS AND THEIR PARTS. xxxi

be looked for than might belong to any conversation among friends who
make a more or less casual meeting the opportunity of indulging ina
somewhat formal debate on a given subject. In spite, however, of the
disclaimer of original treatment which is made in the introductory chapter
(rident numeris eidemque matronibus), no one will be found to contend that
the writer is merely reporting, so faras he could recall them to memory,
the ipsissirno verda of the several speakers. The main lines were no
doubt laid down for him: he adheres to the order of debate (servato
ordene disputationis), and the sentiments-expressed by the various indi-
viduale are evidently in accord with the views which they may have put
forward on the occasion referred to, or at least with those which they
were known to have entertained. But the writer is more than a mere
reporter: he is a constructive artist who, with one main purpose in view,
must have set himself to weld together in a harmonious whole the various
materials on which he had elected to work.

Such defects, or rather difficulties, of plan and construction as have
been charged against the treatise, are obviously attributabie to the incom-
plete and mutilated condition in which it has come down to us. As to
its main motive and purpose, there can be no reasonable doubt. It is an
attempt to discover and set forth the reasons why eloquence no longer
flourishes at Rome as it did in the days of Cicero. Some have thought
that the proper subject oi the Dzologue is the comparative worth of poetry
and eloquence, and the question which of the two branchos a man ofgenius
and culture ought, in existing political circumstances to devote himself
to. But this is the subject merely of the introductory part of the piece
(chs. 1-14), which serves not only as the ‘setting’ of the whole, but also
as a preparation for the note which is sounded in the closing chapters
The causes of the decline of eloquence are not, indeed, direetly dealt
with till the twenty-eighth chapter: but the part immediately preceding
(chs. 15-27), in which Aper and Messalla debate the comparative
merits of ‘ ancient' and ‘modern’ eloquence, is necessary to the com-
position of the whole and quite in place as leading up to the main subject
of the treatise. In spite of the aberrations of some editors, nothing can
be plainer than the fact that it is the reason of the decay of oratory that ¹
is the chief topic of discussion ¹. That was aphenomenon which must
