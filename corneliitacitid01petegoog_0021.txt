author. Who the author was, must remain one of the unsolved problems
of literature: quasnam ex illo aetate conscripsere? Dialogum, ura poterit
ad liquidum perduci.

The year 1841 produced no fewer than three editions of the Dzhlogue, ,

those of Hess,Tross, and Pabst. The two editors first named do not grapple
with the question of authorship, though their work was of value in other
respects; but Pabst earne forward as an uncompromising champion of

. the Tacitean tradition, dwelling not only on correspondences between the

Dialogus and the historical books in regard to the use of words and
figures, &c., but also on the tone of regret for bye-gone times, and the
lament over the decay of morals which readers of Tacitus at once
recognize as so characteristic of his mental attitude. Seven years later,
the appearance of a pamphlet by A. Dupre¹ brought Guttnann again into
the field, without eliciting, however, anything of weight on the negative
side except a renewal of the contention that it would have been
impossible for an author who had written and published the Dialogus
before or during the early part of Domitian’s reign to have lived safely
through the horrors of his administration. Bernhardy, the historian of
Roman literature, sided with the opposition, arguing that the points of
resemblance between the Drhlogue and the other writings of Tacitus were
unimportant when compared with the points of difference,and that the latter
proved more than the former ¹. At this stage of the controversy (1857)
Fr. Weinlraull produced the firstfruits of those exhaustive labours which
entitle him to the credit of having furnished scholars with much of the

material necessary for its settlement⁸. The divergencies from the later style
of Tacitus he explained by reference to the character of the historian's
early studies, and to the eareful imitation of Cicero which both he and his
friend Pliny the Younger seem to have prescribed for themselves; and
founding not only on the general tone of the treatise but also on
a laborious and detailed examination of its language and style, he

concluded that the Dialogue was a genuine work of Tacitus, composed
probably in the early part of Domitian's reign. A similar view as to the
date of the composition (though he afterwards departed from it) was also
taken by Nipperdey in his edition of the Annals: looking, however, to
the introduction to the Agricola, from which it might appear that
Tacitus published nothing during Domitian’s reign, he preferred to
believe that the Dzhlogue was written and given to the world under
