MANUSCRIPTS. lxix

Pres. p. 1) ; but, though this may be true 61 the rest 61 his book, it is
probable that he was acquainted with the text of the Daialogue as given
in the Harlezonus, and several instances 61 true readings hitherto ascribed
16 Puteolanus which are anticipated in the British Museum codex will
be recorded in the commentary. Similar emendations and interpolatione
are to be found also in the editions of Beroaldus (1514) and Beatus
Rhenanus (1519 and 1533). By employing the Farmn'anus (C),
Lipsius put the text 61 Tacitus on a new basis in his great edition
ψ 61 1574, the popularity 61 which may be estimated from the fact that no
’ fewer 111611 1611 re-issues of the work, revised by Lipsius himself, appeared
at Antwerp and Leyden between 1574 and 1607. The last of these
embodied the improvements made on the text by Pichena: and about
the same time the labours 61 Muretus, Pithon, and Acidalius combined
to purge the Draloguc in particular 61 many os the blemisbes which even
then remained upon it. The edition of Gronovius (Amsterdam, 1676 and
1685) does not indicate any independent advance. For the Dialogus,
Brotier went back 16 the MSS, and used the four Vatican codices (1862,
1618, 2964, and 4498) without, however, recognizing the supreme
importance of Vat. 1866 (A). The codex Farnesz'anus (C) still held the
first place, not only in Brotier's eyes, but in those of Heumann (Gottingen,
1719), Schulze (Leipzig, 1788), Drouke (Coblenz, 1868), Orelli (Zilrich,
1830), and Bekker (1831). Next, Egger collated the codex Parcicinsa's
7773, which, however, will be shown below tobes mere copy 61 the
Harlahnus (Η). 111 his edition of 1841, Hess gives the readings 61 the
thoboaenw‘s (V) as reported by Schubart. In the same year came Tross's
collation of 1116 very important codex lobiensis (Β), which had formerly
belonged to Perizonius Of this codex, Ritter made a fresh collation 161
his complete edition 61 Tacitus (1848), and it was thereafter allowed 1ὸ rank
above the Farnesaimur (C). But almost at the same time the Vaticanus
1862 (Α) begins to emerge. Nipperdey was the first to demonstrate its
superiority (Hali. Lita Zcil. 1840), and in his edition 61 the Germania
(1847), Massmann suspected that it must stand on at least 6 footing
of equality with B. The same line was taken by Reifferscheid in his
0161166111 Sustomhnaa (see especially pp. 409 sqq.), and lastly, by
Michaelis, in his critical edition of the Da'ologue (1868). Michaelis
had'examined A for himself in the year 1858, and had come 16 the
conclusion that it was ‘integrior’ than B. To A and B he adheres
closely, as against the Y family oi MSS. Baehrens, on the other hand,
constructed his critical edition (1881) on the theory that the Y family

, contained a truer tradition than that 61 which AB are the representa·

rives: and this theory, taken along with his own tendencies towards
