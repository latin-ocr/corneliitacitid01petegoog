l INTRODUCTION.

is even allowed (23 ad init.) to raise a laugh over the hackneyed esse
vadatur as well as over some of Cicero's inferior witticisms (rotam .
Fortunae, ius Verrinam, ibid). Messalla, on the other hand, quotes him
as a high authority on the necessity of a wide philosophical culture for
the orator (32. 28).

The search for specific resemblances in the Dialogue to the language

and phraseology of Cicero is liable to be overdone¹. Little is to be
gained by recording fortuitous coincidences of expression between two
authors, except in cases where the phrases used by both are marked by
something more or less characteristic and striking. In this view, such
expressions as the following may be noted as being not improbably (see the
notes) conscious reminisceuces of Cicero rather than the ‘current coin’

of the language of Tacitus’s own day: de'em exemere, 19. ro ; contra·
aerstas tueri, 10. 373 redolent antiquitatem, 21. 183 anticorum vertas
tenere, 31. 19. Other resemblances will be found duly noted in the
commentary, but it may be convenient to give a risum! of them also
here (cp. Goelzer, p. xxxV, note). Take the first book of the De Oratore
and cp. ξ 20 etenim ex rerum cognitione efflorescat et redundet oportet
oratio with Dial. 30. 233 ξ 5 3 mii qui naturas domenum uimque omnem
humanitati. ..penetus perspexerit with 31. 105 §72 artelea quae sunt
lt'bero homene dignae . . . quibus apsis, si in dicendo uon utimur, tamen

32. 43 ξ 3² arma qut'bus uel tectus epse esse possis ael prouocare tmprabas
vel te ulcisci lacessitus with 5. 28 3 ξ 31 quid emm est tam admirabile

que'audirentsic afficerentur aretinis ut eos affici uellet orator with 6. 173
and finally the definitlon of orator quoted from De Or. i. 15, 64 in the
notes on 30. 26. Cp. also with 37. 14 His accedebat, dte, De Or. i. 5 15 ἵ
Excitabat eos magnetudo uarietas multitudoque in amni genere causarum.
Reminiscences of the Brutus will be found at 30. 13 and16; 3. 15;
3313. But it is in the general fulness of the style of the Dialogue
that the infiuence of Cicero’s writings on its author may best be traced.
Such synonyms as the following (sometimes with a slightly different
shade of meaning) have a distinctly CiceronIan ring about them, and
have in fact been exactly paralleled by Weinkauff and others: ammi
et ungenti, clamare plausuque, diuitiae et opes, sama et laus, uri et facultas,
memoria et recordatio, modestia ac pudore, operae curaeque.
