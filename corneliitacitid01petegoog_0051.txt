xxxviii INYRODUCTION.

as to the whole purpose of the Dr'ologue, are removed, or at least lessened,
by the theory that Tacitus followed Cicero's example in not introducing
living personages. However this may be, Maternus is undoubtedly the
protagonist of the picce. Itis through him that Tacitus gives expression
to his own thoughts. The future historian saw that his work, too,

would be done, not in the bustle and rocket of the forum, but in quiet
retirement. His regret for the old free-state was tempeted‚ like that of

Matemus‚ bya practical acquiescence in the necessity for the empire.

Itis his voice we seem to hear when the poet-pleader expresses his i

preference for Vergil’s life of repose (mato securum et quz'etum Vergilii
secessum, 13. 4), and when, at the end of the debate, he points out that
every age has its own advantages (nunc quombm nemo eodem tempore
adsequi potest magnoni samam et magnam quatem, bono saeculi autquinque
citra obtrectationem alterius utatur, ch. 41 ad fin). It is, in fact, by the
closing speech that the so-called ‘republicanism’ of Maternus is reconciled
and harmonized with existing political conditions.

Other theories of this closing speech have been put forward by editors,
and remain to be considered. In this edition it is attributed to Matemus‚

not only on the evidence of the manuscripts, but on other grounds as ,
well. lt is in it that we find the fullest expression of that spiritual ,
sympathy between speaker and writer which was evidently Tacitus's ,

motive in making Maternus the main personage of the piece. He is,
as has been said, the protagonist, with whom the discussion begins and

with whom it ends. It has not been noted by any commentator that ¹

the true explanation of the placid manner in which, in the introduction,
Maternus meets the hasty criticisms which are being advanced against
his ‘Cato,' is to be found in his consciousness of his own position. In
the first place, these criticisms are nothing but the outcome of popular
gossip3 sabatae malignorum as they are styled even by the cautious
Secundus¹ (3. 4). Aper does not seem to attach much weight to his
friend's alleged indiscretion; to him it is simply an ‘outburst of his
noble soul' (effervescit vis putcherrimae naturae tuoe), all the more dis·
interested because it was connected with the name of one so far removed
from present-day controversies (prabotas et nostri saemtt contoversrbs)
as Cato. Aper would not shrink from a similar indiscretion himself in
defence of a friend: si quando necesse sr'tpro perr'clttante aratio potentorum
aures offendere, et probata sa'tfides et lr'bcrtos excusato, 10 ad fin. As for
Maternus himself, he has no fears on his own account, no apprehension
that any action will be taken against him. His innocence has hitheno
