SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME OF THE DIALOGUE. xxvii

morti antiqui. In former days, he says, children were brought up by their g
own motherS, who exercised a watchful care that was alierwards fruitful
in results: suus cut'qua filius . . . non in cella emptae nutricis, sed in gremio
ac scitu matres educabatur, curas praecipua laus erat tueri domum et inseruire

liberti. But now they are handed over to Greek nurses and pedagogues,
whose worthless characters are speedily reflected in the minds of their
charges. Moral supervision on the part of parents is a thing of the
past: indeed their influence is rather the other way. Next Messalla

complains that a narrow training in rhetoric has been substituted ior
that wide philosophical culture which was the strength of the speakers of
bye-gone days. Seeing that the orator is one who must be able to
speak fitly and persuasively on any and every topic, he ought to receive
the broadest possible education, including law and history, philosophy
and science. The neglect of what made Cicero great is, in Messalla’s
judgrnent, the first and foremost reason of the decay of eloquence: ergo
lanc premam et praecipuam causam arbziror cur in tantum ab eloquentia
amz'quorum oratorum recesseramus. There are others, but these he will
leave his friends to explain. Maternus, however (ch. 33), suggests that the
contrast he has laid down between the ignorant apathy of his own day
and the enthusiastic and fruitful application of the ancients (differentiam
nostrae desidiae et abscr‘tt'ae adversus acerrima etfemndisse'ma eorum studea)
ought to be followed up by a comparison of the practical exercises (exerci-
tationes) formerly engaged in by aspirants to oratorical fame with those to
which they are confined and limited now. What should be the character
of the training which is meant to serve as a practical preparation for the
exercise of the barrister's profession? This leads Messalla to paint a
vivid picture (34) of the Roman youth oi former days, who after the most
careful home-training, and instruction in all the branches oi a liberal
education (zinbutusjam domestica disciplina, refertus honestis studita) was
introduced by his father or some other relative to one of the most
eminent orators and statesmen of the day, under whose immediate
auspices he speedily acquired familiarity with the actual practice of his
profession. He learned his craft under a master's eye, studying it, not in
any cloistered retreat, but in the open light of day, and face to face with
critical situations (in medea luce atque abiar ritca discrimina). It was on
the battle-field, in fact, that he received lessons in the art of war (pugnare
in proelrb ducebat). What a contrast between the great opportunities
thus afforded of drinking at the well of eloquence pure and undefiled,
gauging the popular tacte, and gaining experience of real issues,-and
the narrowing influences of the school of rhetoric, with its unedi-
fying companionship, its artificia] methods, its stocl subjecta for empty
