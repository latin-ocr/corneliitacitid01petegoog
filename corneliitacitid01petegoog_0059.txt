in repute to the purity, simplicity and nuturalness of republican models.
He makes this plain in the course of his estimate and criticism of Seneca
(x. 1, 125 sqq.), especially in these well-known words: corruptam ct
omnt'bus ur'tn'sfroctum dr'cendi genus reuocare od severiora cadubrii contendo.
Cicero he held forth to his pupils as the great model for imitation: lunc
r'gr'tur spectentur, lroc propositum nolt'r sit exemplum, ille se prosecute scrut
cui Cicero ualde placebit (ib. ξ rra). It is not extravagant, therefore, to

assume that Tacitus may have had the benefit of Quintilian's reaching. ·

But whether or no he was, or had been, actually a student in his school
at the time when the dialogue is understood to have taken place
(74-75 ω), it is impossible to believe that in the interval which elapsed
' between that date and the composition of the treatise Tacitus in no way
came under the influence of one who was gradually making himself
apower at Rome. Iu the year 75, the historian is understood to have
been only about twenty years of age, and had probably just arrived at the
stage of looking forward to actual practice iu the centumviral courts: we
know that it was at this age that his younger contemporary Phny began
his professional work (Epp. v. 8, 8). For the rest, he had attached himself
as an enthusiastic pupil aud companiou to two of the most famous
counsel of the day, Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus: and his zealous
attendance on these masters (see ch. 2) is described quite in the spirit of
one who knew the value of the recommendation which Quintilian lays
down tor the aspiring advocate, oratorem sr'bi aliquem, qaod apud maiores
ficri solebat, deligat quem sequatur, quem tituletur (x. 5, 19). Even if his
preparatory training had been completed by this time, without any assist-
ance from Quintilian, there is still the probability that oue who was
evidently so well marked out for a successful career as Tacitus must ·

have been brought in various ways into contact with the author of the . l

Institutio. Apart from all opportunities of personal intercourse within
the circle of a congenial literary society, Tacitus may have had recourse
to the great teacher for professional help. Quintilian's pupils were not
all boys. The study and practice of declamation were continued at
Rome into later life. There is an ample interval in the nine or ten years
following nn. 75 fortome relationship to have been established, either
personal or prefessional or both, between two of the most interesting
figures in the history of their time.

But however this may be, there'can be no question of Tacitus’s early
appreciation of Cicero, or of the effect of this appreciation on the style of
the Drblogue One needs only to read a few chapters to recognize the
fact that it differs as much from the artificial‚ overdone, and affectedly
incisive style which uras popular at the time as from that which Tacitus
