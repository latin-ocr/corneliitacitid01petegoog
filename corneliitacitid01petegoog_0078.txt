light ‘shortly after the death of Bartolemeo Facio,’ who is known to have
died in 1457: paullomimpasieius moriem in lacem rediere, cam multos annos

of the Leyden codex the following note also occurs, though possibly in
another hand: Hos libellos Iovianus Pantanus excripsit nuper adinventas

These notices may be taken as fixing the date of Enoch’s discovery, “
approximately‚ at 14581. But though the date may be regarded as
settled, other important points in the accounts we have remain still to be
discussed Where was the monastery in which Enoch found the codex
in question? What was the relation of this codex to the other known
codices containing the historical books ol Tacitus? Did Enoch bring the
original with him to Rome, or only a copy?

Three monasteries have been named as containing the library in which
Enoch had his one great stroke of good fortune—those of Corvey in
Westphalia, Fulda in Heme-Caesel, and Hersfeld in the same neighbour-
hood. ln regard to the first-mentioned, no argument can be founded
on the letter addressed byPoggio to Niccoli, in which he names this
monastery: nam da monasterio Corbn'o quod esi in Germania non esi qaod

speres: diciim multos esse in eo libros: non credo rumoribus stultorum. ‚

This was in 1420, several years before Poggio commenced his negotia·
tious with the Hersfeld monle On the other hand, Corvey is almost
certainly known to have been the home of the codex now known as the First
Medicean, before it was abstracted and conveyed to Rome in the early
years of the sixteenth century. But it was from Hersfeld that the monk
came, and the volumes which he held out the prospect of to the expectant
Poggio were not improbably in the librnry which he knew best—that of
his own'monastery. The reason why he failed to implement his promise
may have been either that Poggio did not offer enough ², or that he
found his business prospering at Rome without Poggio’s help. On the

Voigt (see op. cit. i. 258, note) thinks Enoch is believed to have returned to
that the only inserence we are justified in Rome in March 1455, and Voigt doubts
drawing from what Pontanus says is that whether, consideriug bie want of success
the minor works of Tacitus emerged iubis first mission, he would have been
somewhere and somehow between 1457- likely to be selected tor another.
