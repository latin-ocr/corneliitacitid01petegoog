STl'LE AND LANGUAGE. xlvii·

himself subsequently developed in the Annals. In the historian's latest
work every word is charged with almost more than its proper share of
meaning, and the reader's mind is kept always on the strain. In the
Dialogus everything is the opposite. There the style is easy, full,
fluent, and continuous. There is a regular, well-balanced, periodic
structure, which involves at times a certain copiousness even bordes-
ing on redundancy ¹. Only in the use of a few peculiar words and
phrases, in agreater laxity of grammatical constructions, in the infusion
of a certain poetical colouring, and in the free use of figures is the
influence of the Silver Age at all prominent. The style of the Dialogus,
in short, is pretty much what might have been expected aprrori in
a work composed while its author was still comparatively a young man,
given his individual sympathies, his oratorical traiuing, his admiration for
the eloquence of the past, and the character of his subject. ln the
Agricola we have the first stage in the transition to the stylistic ideal
which Tacitus afterwards realized in the Annals. There is no suspicion
of redundancy: the narrative is compact and the periods characterizcd by
agreater brevity than those of the Dialogus. The Germania falls still
further away from rhetorical rotundity: there is an obvious tendency to
dispense with all words that are not indispensable to the thought, and
greater disjointedncss in the periodic structure, such as it is, owing to
a certain disregard of connecting links. But though the Agricola and
the Germania were written some thirteen or fourteen years after the
Dialogus, when Tacitus was over forty years of age, they present several
features of contact with their predecessor ². Not to mention ordinary
instances of synonyms⁸ (the employment of which in the Dialogus is
motived by a love of rhetorical fulness) and hendiadys, there is some·
thing characteristic about the way in which these figures are accumulated
in opposite groups. Take, for example, the following from the Dialogus:
