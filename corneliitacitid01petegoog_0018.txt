THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND DA TE. v

certainly that of those who did not attempt to fasten the treatise on any
known author, but contented themselves with referring to it as an anony-

· mous work qaialim Taciti esse putabatur. This was the attitude adopted

by the great critic of Homer, Fr. A. Wolf, who qualified, however, his
high commendation both of the substance and the form of the ‘aureolus
libellus' by questioning whether it was altogether worthy of so great
a genius as Tacitus.

The reaction in favour of the historian began at the commencement of
the present century. Spalding’s careful study of the text of Quintilian
led him to declare emphatically against the theory which attributed the
authorship of the Dialogue to the great rhetorician¹ ; and the way was
thus cleared for a return to Tacitus. It was under Spalding's auspices
also² that the first intimation was made of the discovery of a parallelism
which seemed at once to decide the question in the historian's favour, 3ηά
which has therefore playeda large part in all subsequent discussions.
A. G. Lange had noted and communicated to Spalding the remarkable
correspondence between certain words which occur in a letter addressed
to Tacitus by his friend Pliny 3ηά awellknown passage in the Dialogus
Referring to the writiug of poetry, Pliny says to Tacitus (Epp. ix. ιο)
poemata... tu sister nemora et lucas catamodiistiae perfici putas,-
words which at once remind the student of the Dialogue of what Aper
is made to say at the end of ch. 9, adice quod partu . . . in nemora
ei lucos, id cst in solitudinem secedendum ert: and of Maternus’s reply,
12. 1 sq. namara vero et luci, et scaranem i'psum quad Aper zircrepabat, =
taniam mr'hi afferunt voluptatem uisitur praecipuos carminum fructur
numerem, quad nec in strepitu, &a lt must be admitted, however, that
unless Pliny intended to make a pointed reference to the author's
identification of his own views with those of Maternus, as his mouthpiece,
there is less than might appear at first sight to found upon in the
parallelism just quoted: the combination nemora et luciis of frequent
occurrence elsewhere, 3ηά Pliny may be merely replying to Tacitus in
words which Tacitus himself had used in a letter previously addressed to
his friend aud correspondent. Of at least equal importance is the more
generalargument put forward by Lange in the dissertation in which he
subsequently expanded his views ³. He laid stress on the known fact that
Tacitus had both a theoretical and a practical acquaintance with the art
oi oratory, and that his historical works contain many examples of his
ability in this department. He also called attention to the remarkable
