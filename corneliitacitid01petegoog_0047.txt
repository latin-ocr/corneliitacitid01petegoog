great rhetorician’s review of literature. The probability is that, like
Secundus, he did not live to attain to the maturity of his powers.

Aper’s chief opponent is Vipstanus Messalla, who is known to us from
the Historia as an energetic supporter of Vespasian against Vitellius ¹.
Messalla is as enthusiastic for the past as Aper is for the present. He

has no sympathy with the emptiness and unrealityof the education which ¹

was provided in his day, and his instincte as a true-born Roman (the

only one, by the way, of all the disputante) lead him to dwell fondly ou ¹

the grean orators of the past and the causes to which they owed their
greatness. To him they realize, far more than any contemporary speaker,
the ideal of what an orator ought to be. He saw that the modern
specialization of the stadam, and its absorption in the technicalities and
trivialities of the schools of rhetoric rendered impossible the acquisition
of that broad culture and those wide interests which had been the glory
of Cicero and his contemporaries It is this that leads him to declaim
against the views which Aper represents with an intensity of conviction
and avigour of language for which he feels impelled half playfully to
apologiae (32 ad fin). He refers contemptuously to the ‘so-called
rhetoricians' (expetuntur quos rhetoras vacant, ·30. 5) whose premature
ac'tivity displaced from the education of the Roman youth broader and
more valuable studies such as history and philosophy, and robbed it of
the sound foundation on which it had formerly rested. His speech is

unfortunately lost just as he is beginning to emphasize the existing ι

divorce of the schools from practical life by picturing the discomfiture of
the aspirant to oratorical renown when he is first transferred from the
technicalities of the lecture-soom to the realities of the forum. Though
a ‘laudator temporis acti' Messalla was himself no recluse, but a man of
action. He had taken an active part in the campaign against Vitellius
and Tacitus was indebted to him for an account of some of its incidente
(Hr'st. iii. 25, 28). His own reputation for eloquence stood high, and
Aper, rn the Dralogue, makes a complimentary reference to the occasion

· when he had gained great farne at Rome by pleading the cause of his

less worthybrother, Aquilius Regulus, before the Senate (ch. 15). This

was in nn. 70 (Hrst. iv. 42). Messalla must of course have been alive four 1

or five years later, when the dialogue is said to have taken place3 but as
tre is pot mentioned in Pliny’s Lettcrs (where allusions to Regulus are
frequent) it hasbeen inferred that he too died young. In fact, it may
