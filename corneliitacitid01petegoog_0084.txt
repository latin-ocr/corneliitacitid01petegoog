codices beside him, and even printed editions, such as those of Puteolanus
and Rhenanus. The general agreement between the variants introduced
by b and the text oi the Harleianus would seem to point, however, to
a different explanation: see p. lxxix.

The common derivation of these two codices (A and B) is obvious
hom the fact that the end of the twenty-fifth chapter of the Germania is

. displaced in both. Their original (X) was probably written bya scribe

who was not so skilful in resolving compendia as the writer of Y: they
each contain corruptions which must be attributed to the writer of X,
seeing that in the corresponding places the members of the Y family give
the text correctly. An excellent example of this, as well as of the
tendeney to emendation on the part of B, occurs in the Suetonius frag.
ment, 127. 30, 3 (Reifferscheid), where we have ypreu A, u'pseum B,
conspectu ECDH, for paped: cp. ib. 126. 30, 15 personalem AB, pro-
consulem E, pcons. H, procos. D, porcos C. From the tradition of A and
B, it is a much easier taslr to restore the text of X than it is to infer from
the other existing codices what must have stood in Y. The copyist of
A followed his original with the most scrupulous care, and made very
few changes: hence A must be regarded as superior to B iu literal
accuracy of reproduction. In doubtful cases, the adbesion of the repre-
sentatives of Y to the tradition of either A or B may be taken as conclusive
of what must bave originally stood in X.

For the Y family, Michaelis cited, in his critical edition (1868), the
readings os the Farnesuanus (C), Vaticanus 1518 (D), Vaticanus 4498 (A),
and ottobonianus (E): to these must be added the Harloamur (H), the
Wndobonensu'r eccur (V), and the Vendobonensui uccxr (Vr)-

The Farnenanus (C) is one of the MSS. which must derive indirecto,
except for the minor works, from the Second Medicean. It contains
Annatr xi-xvi: Hu'st. i-v, the Dialogus, the Germania, and the fragment
of Suetonius. For its relation to other existing MSS. of the historical
books, see Furneaux's Annals, vol. ii. pp. a, 3, where it is classed with
the second group of codices, from one of which Spira is believed to have

printed his editio pruncepr. The addition of the minor works proves that , ¹

it is not earlier than the latter part of the fifteenth century.

The two Vatican MSS. 1518 (D) and 4498 (A) have this in common,
that they contain some minor writings‚ in addition to Tacitus and
Suetonius Their contente are aa follows: in D we have, after Porphyrio’s
commentary on Horace, and a lile of PersiuS, with the commentary
of Cornutus, (a) the Suetonius fragment, (b) the Dzalogue, and (c) the
Germam'a. The Suetonius comes first in Δ, followed by Pseudo-Plenzi'
