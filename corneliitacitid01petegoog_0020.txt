THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND Dara. vil

nence to Gutmann's argument, Orelli himself declared his preference for
the tradition of the Tacitean authorship. To him the Dialogne was
a work of the historian's youth, written while he was still under the
influence of the associations of the schools of rhetoric, and before he had
passed from the stage of enthusiastic adherence to Cicero, as the perfect
model of Latin eloquence‚ to the development of the highly individual
style which characterizes the Historias, and still more the Annali.
The absurdity involved in applying the same standard of criticism to
a dramatic dialogue and a narrative ol events he protests against in the
following words: Aliam orationem exiget narratio rerum, aleam descen
tatio quaestionis ale'cueies. Boni scriptorii est utrumque genus intellectu
distinguere, alterutro uti, excellentis vero parem esse in utrensque orationis
facultate. Atque· ego Taer‘tum excellentem de'cendi artificem existimo, tam vi
naturae quarn arte doctrinaque. Quid mr‘rum egetur si in deinnillimo
genere de‘cendi sibi ipsi detseinellimussuitr‘

If the current of opinion since Orelli's day had set in the same
directim, the history of the controversy might now be considered closed.
But though scholare like Doederlein and Niebuhr sided with the vindicatore
of Tacitus, nothing better than an open verdict was arrived at by Eckstein‚
when he undertook to review all the conditions of the problem as well as
the opinions which had previously been pronounced on either side ¹.
While sully appreciating the force of the various arguments which had
been adduced in favour of Tacitus, and without attempting' to disprove
Α the tradition of his authorship on any such grounds as inferiority of
subject matter or discrepancy of dates, Eckstein concluded that the
disparity of style was so great (ob difficultatem in dicendi genere a Taciti
plane abhorrente positam) that more light must be waited for before any
final deliverance could be arrived at ². For a time negative criticism was
again in the ascendant. Eckstein was followed by H. C. Α. Eichstadt³,
whose views may be found summarized in Orelli's second edition
(1848), vol. ii, p. 523. He believed that the treatise was composed
during the reign of Domitian (though it may not have seen the
'light till the time of Nerva or Trajan) by one who was well read in
contemporary literature, as well as in the works of Cicero. In general,
the style is held to resemble that of Quintilian, though it is admitted that
Spalding had effectually disposed of the theory that Quintilian was the
