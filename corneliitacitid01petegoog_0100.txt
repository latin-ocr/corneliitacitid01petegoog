MANUSCRIPTS. lxxxvii

35. ar must be classed as doubtful (prosequantur X, persequantur Y)
though 1 have adopted what seems to have been the reading of X.

In what may be considered minor matters of orthography, the
advantage is sometimes on the one side, sometimes on the other, e. g. :-

6. 1 iomnde'tas EVM, incenderes H iocunditatis Α, iucunditatebB

10. 16 elegorum ECADH‚ elegorum V² elegiarum AB

26. 23 deminuto HV‚CAD,diminuta AE demunuto B

30. 2 auctom'dus EV2CADH autom‘bus AB

15. 16 concentus ABE (for concentu) concentus v2anH

17.9 statue ABE statuae v2co1), statue H

19. 2 alte AB Ἴ altae ucat), alte H

32. 22 utquoeABDH utque EV2CA

39. 5 tabulam‘a ABDH tabulariae Vp, tabulari! E,
sabulum? Δ

39.9 insum ABDH ipsaEV2CAD ¹

Doubtful are 10. 21 where EV,CA give ortes and ABDH aran and
22. 18 where supellectile has fully as good MS. authority (ABEV,H) as the
more correct form supellectili CAD.

In the following doubtful places the true reading is established by the
agreement of ABEV, as against CAD: H supports the former in the two
first instances, the latter in the third :-

ABEV² CAD
15. 17 aut Asinio aut ab Asr’rrio
22. 23 fiegr'tet ABEVm stegiet CD
37. 17 eepz'latis de expilatis
33.8 ingressuri ingressi DHV, ingraessi CA

The following is doubtful:
17. 28 vocetis ABEV2H vocitetis CAD ·

The probability here is that the reading vocetis is due to the neglect of
a mark of abbreviation: the position is reversed at 22. 2 3 where fugitet
(ABEVp) isright as against fugiet (CD). Cp. 25. 4 where the X family
seems right with constat (ABDH) as against constaret (ECA). On the
other hand it might of course be argued that the superiority of the vocetis
tradition points to the unnecessary insertion of a supposed omitted
syllable itin CDA. The latter are often wrong where ABRV, are right
(Scheuer, pp. 23, 24); though the following must be placed to their
credit:-

33. ιο arte et ruentia CAD arte et inscientia ABEV2H .

37. 11 Metellos et CADH (so b) Metellos sed et ABEV²

The foregoing lists do not include some striking variations as regards
