THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP ΛΝΒ DA TE. xxi

artium domina pulcherrimo comitatu pectora implebat nunc . ..quasi
una ex sordidissimis artificiis discatur. The habit oi ethical reflection

and shrewd psychological observation which manifeste itsell repeatedly in
the historical books is already at work in the Dialogus: 8. 27 diuitiae et
opes, quas facilius inueni'es qui vituperet quam qui fastidiam 13. 4
adligati omni adulatione, nec imperantibus unquam satis servi uidentur
nec nobi's satis liberi,· 18. 15 uitio aulem malignitatis humanae uetera
semper in laude, praesentia in fastidio esse,· 23. 16 prope abest ab
infirmitate in quo sola sani'tas laudatur,· 37 ad lin. in ore bominum . . .
quorum ea natura est ut secura vellicant ,· 40. 5 ciem . . . ad incessendos
principes oi'ros, ut est natura inuidiae, populiquoque ut histriones auribus
uterentur. Such an expression as ut est natura inuidiae, though it
may ol course be paralleled from other writers, has a sort of family
likeness to quae natura paoori's ist, Irlist. iii. 84, io; cupidine ingenii
humani libentius obseura credendi, ib. i. aa, 163 ut ferme acerrima
proximarum odia sunt, ib. iv. 70, 12, and many other phrases familiar to
students of Tacitus. The closing deliverance ol Maternus, ch. 41 ad fin.
nunc, quoniam nemo eodem tempore adsequi potest magnam samam et
magnam quietem, bono saeculi sui quisque citra obtrectationem atterius
utatur reminds the reader of the famous utterance in the Agricola
(42, 18) sciant quibus moris est inlicita mirari, posse etiam submotis
principibus magnos oinos esse, obsequiumque ae modestiam, si industria
ae vigor adsint, eo laudis escendere quo plerique per abrupta, sed in
nullum reipublicae usum, ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt. The sentiment
ol acquiescence in the necessity lor the rule of a single man, which finds
expression in this closing speech, is another clement in the identification:
the whole political tone¹ is quite consistent with that which we know
was adopted by Tacitus. Again, that feeling ol regret lor the past which
seems to have entered into the very composition ol the historian’s genius
is exemplified in the poet-pleader's first speech (ll-13), with its beautiful
picture ola golden age (ep. Ann. iii. 26). But it is in the sphere ol
moral sentiment that the resemblance is most pronounccd. Messalla's
lament over the oblivio moris antiqui (28. 6) vis fitly put into his mouth
hythe writer who made even his Germania an opportunity lor introduc-
ing weighty reflectione anthe moral decadence oi Rome. Here Messalla
speaks for Tacitus—the Tacitus whom we know from his other works.
When the speaker bewails the general effacement ol the ‘good old
ways' the shamelessness of the present day (29. 7), the decay of careful
moral training at home (29. a), hc is uttering the sentiments of the writer
