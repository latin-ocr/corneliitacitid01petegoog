xxiv INTRODUCTION.

γ’ serviceableness (utilit l, the pleasure which it confers (voluptas), and the
prestige (degustem sama, laur) which it wins for the orator (chs. 5-8),
witha corresponding depreciation of poetry as being altogether barren
and unprofitable in all these respects (chs. 9, 10). Aper is the realist,

the practical man of the Dialogus, whose formula in estimating the
worth of poetry is the familiar Cui bono? (9. 5). in the honr of need,
itis to the pleader, he says, that even poets must have recourse.
Saleius Bassus has to beg people to be good enough to come and hear
him give a reading of what he has written with so much expenditure of
time and trouble; and even this costs him money. Eprius Marcellus,
on the other hand, and Vibius Crispus hold a glorious place. Their
friendshlp is a real boon to the emperor, as bringing him something
which it passes the power even of an emperor to give: while Bassus has
to be thanktul if princely favour should enrich him, as it lately did, with
agift of money that only serves to bring his dependence on his patron
into greater relies. Yet Aper is not without an appreciation of poetry,
in its proper place. His quarrel is not with poetry, but with Maternus’s
preference for poetry: tecum mehr} Materne, res estquod, eram natura te
in ipsam arcem eloquentiae ferat, errare maur‘s et summa adepturus in
leotaribus subustus . . . nune te ab auditoriis et theatris in farum et ad
causas et ad uera preclua vaco (ch. 10). In concluding his impeachment,
Aper points out that poets of Maternus's temperament do not even enjoy
the advantage of quiet security and freedom from offence; more will be
forgiven to the pleader who is outspoken on behalf of a living friend
and client than to a poet who goes out of his way to extol the virtues
of a dead Cato.

The short reply of Maternus (chs. 11-13) forms one of the most
interesting portions of the book. The personal contrast between him
and Aper is crystallized in two phrases which occur at the opening of
the eleventh chapter: Aper had spoken acrius, ut solebat, et intento
ore, Maternus is remersus et subridens. To this picture both characters
remain true throughout the plece. in glowing language‚ ‘fitter for a poet
than for aa orator,' Maternus eulogizes the poet's life as the ideal to
which he intends henceforward to devote himself. Conscious of his ·
own blamelessness, he has no fear that he will ever be called upon to
exert his oratorical powers except in the defence of others (pro altmar
discrimine). It is the charm of the poet's life that has'captivated him:
'mid the quiet of grove and glade will he live, in the hallowed haunts of
song, far from the ‘madding crowd' of clients and suitors and morning·
callers. And the poet is as famous, he contenda, as the orator: Homer
does not bow before Demosthenes, and Cicero meets with more detraction
