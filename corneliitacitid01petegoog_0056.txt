THE INTERLOCUTORS AND 'THEIR PARTS. xliii

clarescit (36. a)¹.' ln chs. 36 and st his main point is clearly and
distinctly stated. Just as afterwards in chs. 40 and 41 the supe-
riority of republican eloquenee is fully recognized (40.8 magna illa et
notabilis eloquentia . . . tulit sine dubio valentiorem eloquentiam ; 41. 22
summ illa laus et gloria i'n eloquentia: cp. 37. 3), so in these opening
chapters (as also iu ch. 38) the speaker sets forth clearly the disad-
vantages that were bound up with astate of things favourable to the
productiori of great orators: illa perturbatione ac li'centi'a . . . ini'icti's
'omnibus et moderatore uno carentibus . . . turbidis et inquietis temporibus.
Nothing of this need be taken as censure; the speaker knows the differ-
enee between peace and war (37. 32), and can appreciate the former
without failing to recognize that the latter is the best training-school of
suldiers. But, unlike Messalla, Maternus does not believe that a return
of such political conditions is either practicable or desirable. It may
be impossible now to realize again the magna et notabilis eloquentia that
was the glory of the republic, and for which she paid so high a price
(36. ι4; 40. 25). Things have altogether changed Orators are of less
consequence now than they used tu be, and eloquenee has to content
herself with a contracted sphere (cp. omissis forensium causarum angus-
tiis, 4. 8). But Maternus cau at least console himself by utilizing the
advantages of his own peaceful times, and devoting himself to the
pursuits of a learned leisure (cp. 4 ad fin. sanctiorem illam ct augus-
tiorem eloquentiam colam). High oratorical renown and settled repose are
incompatible with each other: therefore while recognizing the superiority
of the eloquente which was nurtured on the disorder of former times, let
every one be thankful for peace aud quietness-and make the best use
he can of his talents and opportrmities.

Tau importance of a consideration of the language and style of the
Dialogue, as bearing on the problem of its authorship, has been indicated
in the introductory section. Its obvious want of resemblance to the
style of the Annals was the first gruum ou which Lipsius and his

· ¹Atteut1'0u has also been called to question and other indicatione afa style
his frequent use of the figure Amphora pitehed in a lofty key, as was that of
(see p. lix), as well as the rhetorical Maternus.
