THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP AND Dara. iii

owe its survival, had evidently proclaimed itself to be the work of Tacitus, ’
would have been either accepted without cavil and criticism or boldly
denounced as aforgery and a fraud. Habent rua fata libelli. Ar first,
indeed, the Dialogue was unhesitatingly included, along with the other
writings of thehistorian, sofar as then known, in the editio princeps, pub·
lished by Vendelin de Spira at Venice in 1470. This was within some
twelve or thirteen years ol its re-appearance. But when the discovery, in
1508, of the first six books of the Annals had given fresh evidence not
only of the historical bent of the genius of Tacitus, but also of the peculiar
individuality of his style, doubts began to be entertained. It seemed
difficult to believe that the easy and flowing language of the Dialogrce .
could rightly be attributed to the writer who had employed what was
almost a new methodos literary expression in the terse, pointed, and
pregnant phraseology of the Annali. And as the codex from which his
minor works had been recovered contained also treatises by other authors,
including Suetonius's fragment De Grammaticis et Rlcctaribus, it was
supposed that the ascription of the Dc'alague to Tacitus, in the title,
might be the mistake ofa scribe, who had inadvertently confounded with
the writer of the Agricola and the Germania the author of a work on
altogether different lines, which it had been found convenient, at some
time or other, to include inasingle codex along with these. The earliest
literary expression of these scruples is to be found in the edition of
Beatus Rhenanus (Bilde of Rheinau in Elsass) which appeared at Bate in
1519 and again in 1533. Rhenanus inclined to believe that the Dcalague
was a comparatively late work, which had been skilfully invested with the
appearance of antiquity by the introduction of personages and events
belonging to the age of Tacitus. But he gave only an uncertain sound.
His half-hearted deliverance—Hunc dc'cclogum arla credideram esse Taciti
—had nothing like the effect on contemporary opinion that was afterwards
produced by the more pronounced scepticism of the great Dutch scholar
J. Lipsius. In the preface to his famous edition of the year 1574,
Lipsius declared against the Tacitean authorship with all the confidence
of an inspired literary oracle (tam certum. . . quam si respondisset
Apollo). His main ground was that which has been founded on ever
since, the obvious difference of style: siclus valde abnuit, nan fallax in
hoc genere argumentum, quiin nostra constrictus abr'que, teres, aculus ct
treverus magis quam leprilus, laic omnia cantra. To the argument that
style may vary witha writer's advance in years and with the subject of
which he treats, Lipsius replied that such change is possible only within
certain timirs, never to the extentos a complete transformation (nam-

quam ita ut prorsus abacia sese). He did not hesitate‚ however, to class
