of the hitherto undiscovered writings of Tacitus. Α certain monk, who
was charged with important business at the Papal Court, had once
intimated to him that he knew where several volumcs were to be found,
one of which contained what Poggio designates as alc'pua mera Cornelii
Taciti nobis ignota—probably the codex in which the minor works

afterwards carne to light. The monk, who had doubtless a proper ¹

appreciation of Poggio's influence at court, as well as of his weakness'for

⁴ old manuscripts, undertook to fumish him with a list of books belonging

to the library of an ancient German monastery, inventarium cuiusdam
vetustissimi monasterti in Germam'a, ubi est augens librorum copim In
1427 the monh, now described as ‘of Hersfeld' (Hersfeldensis) brings

the promised inventory, with which Poggio is greatly disappointed. Part ζ

of it, however, he forwards to Niccolo: Mitte autem ad te nunc partem

⁴ cmumtarc'i sui, in que describitur uolumen illud Cornelii Taciti et alibrum

quibus caremus .· quae cum sint res quaedam parvulae, nonsatis magui sunt
aestimandae. Decidi ex magna spe quam conceperam ex verbis suis. The
monk promised to bring him the Tacitus codex, and Poggio waited

immtiently for it. But it did not arrive. In the end of 1428 he writes t
to Niccoli, Cormlcics Tacitus silet inter Germanos neque quicquam cxricdc ’

naui percepi de eius operibus. The Hersfeld brother came again to Rome,
but without the wished-for codex, whereupon Poggio gave him awarm
reception. He undertook to bring it on his next joumey 3 butas Poggio
makes no further allusion to the matter in his correspondence, we are
led to conclude that the monk's tergiversation compelled him to abendon
the hope he had entertained so long.

lt is of course impossible now to identily the codex to which this
incident relates, hut we may infer with some probability that it was the

one afterwards brought to light hy Enoch of Ascoli. Only one copy of ἒ

the Dialogue, along with the Germam'a and the fragment of Suetonius
dc Grammaticis et Riecteribus, is known to have survived down to the
days of Poggio. It became the parent of the various MSS. of those
treatises which we now possess, and which can all he proved to derive
from it and it only ¹. It was the discovery of this codex, in a German
monastery, that rewarded Enoch's later journeyings, after his first patron
Nicholas V had passed away. The authority for this statement is a note
which, when he published his edition of the Germania and the Dialogue in
1841, L. Tross reported from the Leyden codex (B). This note was
appended hyJovianus Pontanus (1426-1503) to the original of which the
Leyden MS. is a copy, and is to the effect that Enoch's codex came to
