MANUSCRIPTS. lxxix

Hortabnur-the occurrence at the end of the Suetonius of a remarkable*
note, in the hand of me copyist, Hic ontr'quisszinum exemplar finit et troc
tirtegrum oedem. Taken along with indications which go to show that
the original of H must have been a MS. abounding in contractione, this
must be held to render it probable that it was no mere copy that Enoch
brought back with him to Italy, but his original ‘find '—the Hersfeld
codex-probably of the thirteenth century. lf this inference is correct,
a lineal descent may be established for H from the archetype of Fulda.

Perhaps the most striking internal characteristic of H is its frequent
agreement with the hand in the Lezitensis known as b (see p. lxx). If b
is as late as is generally supposed, the probability is that its readings were
derived from H, or from some similar copy executed about the same
time. For proof of this agreement, reference might be made to the
critical notes, but it may be instructive to exhibit here some of the
resemblances referred to, as well as some of the differenees between
the two traditions.

The following examples in which H and b agree are probably in
many cases the result of an independent attempt on me partos the
copyist of H to resolve the compendia in his original. The oldest editions
(Spirensis and Puteolanus) generally present the same readings :-

5. 12 solicite for societate; 515 nationes for necessitudinem 5. 2 5 praesidio
for profugi03 5. 26 irrepat for increpuit; 6. 18 quacunque for quemcum-
que; 7. 10 in codicillis for codicillb3 8. 7 eitra eloquentia om. H, del. b;
12. 14 ne aut illud clamore for nec ullis aut glon'a maim 25. 8si quo mimo
for in qua m'mirum (i); 31. 31 civitatem for comitem (?); 33. 24 circa ora-
ton'am (or -um) for esse oratorum.

Other resemblances between H and b are :—

5. 11 arbitrium 5. 12 sedet ipsum 6. 18 induxerit; 10. 33 rightly hinc
(so Put.); 10. 34 wrongly him (for hoec) ; 21. 3 Canuti 3 21. 28 quia3 23. 7
isti om. H, del. bC ; 29. 4 et virides om. H Put., del. b; invenies 29. 12.

On the other hand, H and b differ in the following places :-

1. 17 vetat H (Sp), notat b, vocat Put.; 8. 1 tunc 'Eprium bPut, here
propn'um H ; 8. 11 haberemus H, habemus b; 8.12 angustia ereptum H, an-
gustiae parentum b 3 ’10. 5 nedum b, metrum H (Sp. Put.) 3 15. 6 malignius
b, malignus tu's H (Sp.); 21. 15 parte sectum H, parte seu b; 21. 35 rubor
H, roturb; 21. 38 quam b, inquam H ; 25. 13st’c b, sicut H ; 25.16si iureb,

33. 22 illud b, id H (and D) ; 36. 2ο parabat b, probabat H.

The copyist of H left blanks in his text (some of which have been
