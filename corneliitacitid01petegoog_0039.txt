xxvi INTRODUCTION.

Kt compositions of former days, with their intricate arrangement and

i technical divisions—the ‘book-speeches' made to order according to
the precepts of Hermagoras and Apollodorus—must give place to the
animation and retinement (fuleham et pulchritudinem orationis) that have
now become indispensable: nauis et exquisitis eloquentiae itineribus opus
est per quae mator furnilium aurium ffugrat. Finishing with a short
review of the antiqui (al-23), Aper contenda that the Ciceronian
age is really overrated: Calvus, Caelius Caesar, Bmtus‚ Asinius Polli0,
Messalla, Corvinus, and Cicero himself, are weighed in the balance and
found wanting. In one case the diction is slovenly (sudes amborum),
and the rhythm defective (hians compositam: in others there is a want of
the ‘buoyancy and polish' that mark present-day eloquence (laetitiam
nitoremque nostrorum temporum). When those who confine their ad-
miration to the past praise its speakers for their fsound, pure style,'
they only confess that these speakers were wanting in vigour: parum est
aegrum uon cuasarum et laetum et alacrem uolo : prope adest ab infirmitate
iu quo sola raua'tas laudatur.

When Aper has finished, Maternus (while complimenting him on his
spirited and ingenious defence of his own age) calls on Messalla to fulfil
his promise to set forth the causes of a decline which he himself regards
as an established fact. Messalla’s speech (25-27) consists of a vigorous
vindication of the antiqui from Aper’s accusations, and an attack on
the ‘curling-tongs and jingle-J'ingle' (calamiitror et dunatus) of such
later speakers as Maecenas and Gallio, with a general impeachment of
his own times as degenerate and effeminate. He is prepared to cite
examples from the past, and match them against any which Aper may
put forward ; but Maternus again interrupta, and recalls the speaker to
the original theme. It is the explanation of the phenomenon, he sayS,
that they wish to have from him, not a mere statement of fact. Messalla
then proceeds (ch. 28) to unfold the causes of the decline of eloquence
from two points of view, taking first the methods of early nurture and
theoretical training which obtained in former days, and contrasting them
with the laxity and indifference of his own time (ta-32), and then, after
a few remarks from Maternus, comparing also the practical exercises
of the antiqui with those of the novi (33-35).

lt is in this part of the treatise that the author of the Dialogue first

begins to discuss directly the answer to the question announced in the
opening sentence. That Messalla is meant to appear as a ‘laudator
temporis acti’ is obvious from the fact that he leads off by at once attri-
buting the decline, not only of eloquence, but of the other arts as well to
