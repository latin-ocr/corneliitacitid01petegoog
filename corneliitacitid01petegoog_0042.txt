SUBSTANCE AND SCHEME' OF THE DIALOGUE. xxix

incidents as these, however regrettable in themselves, were far morel,
inspiring than the rontine practice of police-courts and petty-sessions.
Political and social disturbance is the best stimulant for oratory. Every
one knows that peace is to be preferred to war3 but it is war that brings
out the soldier. So it is with eloquence (chs 37, 38).

Again, the forms of judicial procedure and the practice of the law·
courts were more conducive to good speaking in former days. Then
a pleader could take as much time as he liked, and there was a very
wide freedom of adJ'ournment. And the centumviral courts,·—the great
sphere of ferensic oratory now-were formerly of little account: they
were eclipsed by the brilliant surroundings of other tribunals (splendore
alierum rabinorum obruebantur). Morever, the habit of speaking in
the paenula, and in chambers or offices, is not favourable to oratorical
animation. The stimulus of an audience is wanting, and the incitement
of applause: things are not now as they were in the days when the
forum was crowded with an interested assemblage, when deputatione
carne up from the country-towns to show their interest in a case-cum
in pleresque eiade'cz‘ei crederet populus Romanu sua inuresse quadrudicaretur.
And in former times the frequent public meetings, and the notoriety to
be gained by the impeachment of¹ distinguished individuals, supplied
agreat stimulus. Again must the truth be stated: eloquence thrives
on disorder. Nande ahora et quieta re loquemur et quae probibate et
modestia gaudeat, sed est magna illa et notabilis eloquentia alumna strenuae,
quam stulti libertatem uocabant, comes seditionum, effrenab'populi incitamen-
tum, seue obsequele, sine onitate, contumax, temeraria, adrogans, quae iu
bene constitutis cebetatrbus non ore'tur. At Athens, where power lay in
the hands of the multitude, orators were numerous; at Rome, in earlier κ
days, there was greater oratorical vigour, but the country had a heavy
price to pay in the attempted revolution of the Gracchi and in the
death of Cicero (chs. 39, 40).

From this point of view, the surviving traces of the old fomm are only
aproof osa society that falls short of ideal perfection. In the ideal
state, free from all taint of wrong-doing, the orator will be as super-
fluous as the physician among those that are not sick. aanor oratorum
bonor obscuriorque gloria est anter bonos mares et in obsequium regentes
paratos. The transference of power from the popular assembly to the
emperor (sapientissimus et unus), with all the consequent changes, has con·
tracted the sphere of eloquence. Circumstances alter cases If you, my
friends (the speaker concludes), had lived under the republic, and if the old
orators had changed places with you, you could not have failed to
achieve the highest oratorical renown, while they would not have been
