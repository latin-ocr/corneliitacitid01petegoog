followers were led to question the genuineness of the treatise. Close
examinatior has, however, furnished many evidences on the other side.
Critics are still indeed found who, like Novak, make the undoubted
resemblance which can be traced between the language of the Drologue

and that of the Institutio Oratorio an argument for the theory that
Quintilian must have been the author, not Tacitus. But exclusive atten-

tion to this resemblance, even though it extends in several passages to
thought and substance as well as to forms of expression, is very apt to
mislead,¹ especially when it is overdone. A safer method is to compare
Tacitus, not with Quintilian, but with himself. The theory of a con-
tinuous development of his style through his various writings has been
worked out by Wolfflin (Philologus, xxv, pp. 9²·134) and other scholars ¹3
and numerous arguments in proof of the authorship of Tacitus may now
be drawn from the very source which formerly supplied antagonistic
critics with their most trusted weapons.

In the first place it must be repeated that, on the theory that the
Dialogtu was the work of the historian’s youth, it seems to have been
a natural and appropriate outcome of the studies in which that youth is
known to have been trained. The early bent of a student iu those days
was generally towards rhetoric and the art of public speaking. This was
the broadest avenue to public life at Rome, and Tacitus may have
followed it from motivas of general conformity as well as from private
and persona} choice. But his genius must have felt a strong affinity for
the art which, iu the perfection which it had attained to under the
republic, stands now for us as one of the symbols of his country’s great-
ness. We know that he gained high distinction as an orator iu the
earlier part of his career. The younger Pliny, who was only some six or
seven years his junior, has left it ou record that his friend and corre·
spondent had aheady established a great reputation (cum tom tu soma
gloriaque floreres, vii. ao, 4), when he himself was just entering public life.
And even alter Tacitus had retired from the profession of an advocate, his
funeral eulogy of Verginius Rufus (nn. 97) gave proof of his great gift
of eloquence²; while his official prosecution, coniointly with Pliny, of
Marius Priscus proconsul of Africa (in roo an.) evidently produced
on his colleague that impression of elevation and dignity which no reader
can fail to carry away from the study of the historian's works ⁸.
