quaestionis meminerimus sciamusque nos de ea re loqui quaefaeilius turbidis
et inquietes temporibus exsistit. Andresen thinks that in several passages
in 40, 41 Maternus is taking up and replying to the utterances of the
previous speaker; but it is much preferable to regard him as empha-
sizing his points by repetition ¹. And nothing is gained with regard to
the alleged inconsistency of his sentiments by making Maternus only
begin to speak at 40. 7: such an utterance esest magna illa et notabilis
eloquentia alumna libentiae, quam stulti libertatem uocabant, comes semitonum,
tte. stands as much in need of the explanation which has been given
above as anything that occurs in the previous chapters, which are
assigned, on the theory under discussion, to Secundus or Messalla.

The main argument in favour of assigning to Secundus the whole
speech from chs. 36 to 41 is that it seems appropriate in the mouth of
one who was intended to act as a sort of mediator between Messalla
and Maternus. Itis thought too that the reference to such a detail
as the wearing ol the paenula (39. 3) is more natural in his mouth
than in that of Maternus: cp. detegentes stili anxietatem (l. ro), which
has been taken as an indication of Secundus's consciousness of this
characteristic of his own style. The historical tone ol ch. 36, and the
reference in 37. 7 to the literary labours of Mucianus have been
thought to reveal the studious barrister‚ who has already made a name
for himself by writing biography (16 ad fin).

But, if this speech is given to Secundus, it is difficult to imagine that
another can have fallen out after ch. 41, before the words Fem‘erat
Maternus in ch. 42. The discussion is fitly brought to an end in the
text as we have it: another speaker could not have wound it up better
than with the closing words of ch. 41 bono saeculi sui quisque ee'tra
obtrectationem alternus utatur. There is also the other obvious considera·
tion that if Secundus is provided for in 36-40, and Maternus in a sup-
posed lacuna alter 41, it becomes increasingly difficolt to conjecture
what can have filled the great lacuna at the end of 35. On the
explanation given above of his personal attitude‚ there is no real difficulty
in adhering to the consistent tradition of the manuscripts and taking
Maternus as the speaker of chs. 36-41 in one continuous whole. We
seem to recognize his lofty style even in the first sentence: Magna
eloquentia, se'cut flamma, matura aletur et motibus excitatur et urendo

¹In addition to the nse of the beginning Quae nmla suut nen ueeidm
phrase ut subinde Mmanea in the pas- melius est in 88. 18. Cp. also Non
suge just quoted, we may compare the quia tanta fuerit &c in 37. 27 with
sentence beginning Quae singula etsi Sed nee tanti rei publicae . . . 40
distrahebant. . ‚in 86. 14 with that ad fin.
