THE QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP ANB DA TE. xiii

from July r, 74, to July 1, 75. According to this calculation, the con-
versation recorded in the Dr'alogm must have taken place in that year: if
on the very anniversary of Cicero's death (in hunc daim), on December 7,
nn. 74. But this gives, strictly speaking, only 116 years as the interval
which has eiapsed since the death of Cicero, not rao years as stated in
the text. Again, in enumerating the reigns of which the sum total is
, composed, the manuscripts give 59 for Augustus, ²3 for Tiberius, 4 for
Caligula, 28 for Claudius and Nero,'1 for Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and
6for Vespasian: atotal of rar years. This last discrepancy need not
be considered of much weigbt‚ especially in view of the approximate
character of some of the constituent factors, as, for example, prope
quadrrinm'um Gai: itis sufficiently accurate for the speaker’s purpose.
A more serious difficulty consists in the ascription of 59 years to
Augustus when as a matter' of fact he ought to be credited with only
56 (nuc. 711-767). Some have proposed to leave this standing, as
an error of the writer or the speaker (cp. 34 ad fin, where we have nono
decemo for uno el at'ccsimo) ; but it is hardly likely that a figure doubtless
so well-known would have been incorrectly given. Lipsius therefore
changed novem to sex, and all editors follow his lead. But this gives only
118 years as the total, a consideration which has led to the obvious sug·
gestion that centum etduodevrgr'nli should be substituted in the text for
centum ἐἰ vrgr'ntr'. It is usually considered more probable, however,
(especially in view of the repetition of the figure at the end of ch. 24),
that centum et vzgr'nti is given as a round number, summing up in a
general way the duration of the constituent principates as stated in what
goes before. In any case, it is impossible to make centum et vz'gr'nn
square exactly with sexta slah‘o in the sense of the sixth year of
Vespasian’s reign.

The numbers have in all probability been tampered with by some
reader who was anxious to correct the speaker’s arithmetic: this is almost
certainly the origin of the unhistorical nouem el quthuagr'nta for the
duration of the reign of Augustus. If we suppose that Aper dated Ves-
pasian's reign from the time of his arrival in Rome, in the middle of the ”
year 7ο, instead of from July 1, 69, we must follow most editors in
lixing on nu. 75 as the year in which the dialogue was held. This
would give, on the inclusive method of reckoning, 118 years as the exact in·
terval (437- 75) : afigure with which the detailed enumeration correspondS,
if we adopt Lipsius’s emendation Statue sex et quzirquaginta annos.
On this explanation also centum et vagina must be either a round number
or a mistake for centum et duodevr'gr'nli. Something might be said in
favour of the year no. 76, if we were to make three emendations on the
