xvi INTRODUCTION.

birth his biographers'have been able to arrive approximately hya process
oi inierence. He tells us in the Historias (i. r) that his official career
began under Vespasian, and that he received promotion from both Titus
and Domitian. This must mean that he was quaestor in the first·
mentioned reign, and either tribune or aedile under Titus: while we
know that he held the praetorship in an. 88. Titus reigned irom June
79 to September 8r; and, as it is improbable that more than one year
intervened between his tenure oi the two lower offices, we may infer that
Tacitus was quaestor in either 78 or 79. A necessary qualification for
this office was that a candidate should have attained his twenty-fifth year,
so that we may take it that the year oi his birth must be hired at nu. 53
or 54. This would make him about twenty at the date at which he was
present as a listener when the conversation reported in the Dcalogoc took
place: a time oi lite which agrees admirably with the phrase chaonis
admodum. Is, with othere, we adopt the year 56 as the date of his
birth, he may have been two years younger: and either supposition suits
the description which he gives oi himself as a follower oi two oi the most
famous oi contemporary pleaders, Aper and Secundus (2. 6).

The next point to be settled, on the theory that Tacitus wrote the
Dialoguc, is the date at which it was composed and published. Here the
views of the critics diverge, as we have already seen, very considerahly.
Many of them have given undue weight to the passage in the Agricola in
which Tacitus resers to Domitian's reign as a period during which ‘the
young have passed to old age, aoc'th closed lips, and the old almost to the
very goal and term oi life ¹.’ From the phrase pcr sc‘lcnlcicm it has been
inferred that Tacitus cannot have written anything oi any kind in the
reign of Domitian, and the conclusion drawn has been that the Dc'aloguc
must have been composed either in the reign ol Titus or else after
Domitian’s death, about the same time as the other minor works. But in
the passage under consideration, Tacitus is speaking as a historian who
(though he may have been industriously collecting material in the evil
days which had now come to a close) is hailing a happier era as per·
mitting him at length to break the silence into which he had been
coerced. It is quite conceivable that, whether published or not at the
time of composition, sucha work as the Dc'aloguc might have been written
in the earlier and brighter years of Domitian's reign. Too much has no
doubt been made of the necessity oi postulating a considerable interval
between the time at which the conversation took place and the time at
which the treatise was composed, in order to account sor the use oi the
