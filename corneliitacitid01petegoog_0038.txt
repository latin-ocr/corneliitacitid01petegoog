nowadaysthan Vergil. In contemporary life, a Secundus'Pomponius

may hold his own with a Domitius Aper. As for Crispus and Marcellus,
he envies them not: freedmen are often as powerful as they, and they

· have to pay the penalty of their position: nec imperantibus unquam satzi
serni ue'dmtur nec nobis satit [ὥστ’.

Maternus concludes in a sort of ecstasy of inspiration (concitatus et
velut instructus), and atthis point (eh. 14) the company is re-inforced
by the entrance of Vipstanus Messalla He apologizes for his intrusion;
but, on being reassured by Secundus, expresses his gratification at finding
his friends interested in such discussions as that on which they had just ’
been engaged. Secundus he congratulates on his literary sympathies‚ and
Aper, more ironically, on his adherence to the topics of the schools, and
his exaltation of the methods and exercises of the new rhetoric over the
wider culture of the orators of old. This brings us to the real subject
of the heatise, the decadence of oratory, which Messalla says he often
tries to explain to himself, and cannot believe that Aper means seriously
to deny. The two speeches of which the next part consiste (lo-27),
those of Aper and Messalla, tum on the comparative merits of Ciceronian
and contemporary eloquence.

Aper begins with a protest (16,17) against the use of the term
antiqui. He refuses to admit that the orators of the late republic and
the early empire (Cicero, Caesar, Caelius, Calvus, Brutus, Asinius,
Messalla) are ancients at all. Both noui and antiqui may be said
to fall within the limits ofa single life: in Britain he had himself seen an
old man who had fought against Caesar, and so might conceivably have
heard Cicero. Theclassical period, in fact, is not yet over. There is
no essential difference between ‘new' and ‘old¹,' except in the minds
of those who habitually disparage the present as compared with the past:
vt'tm malignitatis huntanaa vetera semper in laude, praesentia in fustalino.
Eloquence, like everything else, passes through stages of development ;
it is not tied down to one fashion of feature: mutantur cum temporibus
sumac quoque et genera dtimdi. Contemporarytendencies maybe justified
by referenceto an improved standard oi taste and a developed culture.
It was not from lack of ability or ignorance that Cassius Severus, with
whom the decline is said to have hegun, adopted his peculiar style: he set
himself deliberately (iudana et intellectu) to effect a change that was called
for by an age which had now grown weary of the old dulness and want
oi polish (tm'stem et impexam antiquitatem). The long and wearisome
