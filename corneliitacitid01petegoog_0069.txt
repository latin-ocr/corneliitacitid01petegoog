lvi INTRODUCTION.

47, 1 ; ensegne'tcbr iii. 70, 103 metuentior xiii. 25, 15, and many other
instances. Among more or less peculias uses of adjectives may be
noted secundus 3³. 5 (secunde'ssina earnm studea: cp. Quintilian’s phrase
studemuensrnctnsmg,2; rita, 35 11, 4);'bealns9.19;altus 1113
(alitor serena, i.e. graae’or sermo: cp. Quint. iii. 8, 42 aletae quaeste'o): also
the personal construction with manasestus 16. 11. The peculias use of the
future participle may also be mentioned heres see on mansurum 9. aa.

As to Pronoune, the use of hic with reference to contemporary
circumstances is characteristic both of Tacitus and Quintilian: see on
28. 95 32. 13, and cp. 37. 6 ; Germ. iii. 3, xx. 1. Instances of et e'pse
occur 30. 1 and 37. 15.

In regard to Verba, it is well known that Tacitus shows a growing
tendency to prefer simple forms to their corresponding compounds
Here are a few examples. Adsueseere occurs Dial. 20. 9; ³4. 63 Agr.
xvi. 193xxi.3; Germ. iv.8:sneseere, Ann. ii. 44‚a; 5a.4;xiv. 27, 8.
adreverenter. 16. 7 ; Agr. xxi. 4: entrare, He'st. v. 23, 5; Ann. ii. 78,
9. Innotescere, De‘al. 10. 53 He'st. iv. 50, a, whereas notescere is the form
used in the Annals. Demonstrare occurs four times in the Dealogne,
e. g. 7. 17: in. the Agricola and Germania the simple form is found as
frequently. The author's preference, in the Dealogae, for compound
forms is made an ¹argument for the retention of depaeaverat 38 ad fin,
where see note. Cp. the frequent use in the Annals of paratas for
apparatus (De'aI. 22. ar). On the other hand we have in the Deblcgrn
flexesse 19. 4 ; finire (for definere) 38. 6 ; cludere 30. 263 pensare 40 ad
fin. ; vanescere 10. 25 ; serre (for efferre) 19. 17 ; serrae· 17. 173 32. 9:
cp. also 25. 9: while afew cases are doubtful, as sequetur- enseqae'tnr 10. 3,
and perhaps hortatur-exhortatur 14. 9. .

It is hardly necessary to illustrate the development of the usage by

which compound verbs take a simple accusative instead ofa prepositional
construction: cp. however antecedere 25. 153 praecurrere 25. 5, and see
Draeger 5 40.
. The frequent use of the perfect subjunctive, in modest assertione, is
also to be noted, eg. tenuerim 18. a; cesserit 13. ro; denerata 32. 223
vocaverim 18. 4; non negaverant 26. 143 Draeger 5 28. So even a! sic
denere'm 34. 8; 40. 19.

Among other peculiarities may be mentioned a certain preference for
the plural verb even in cases where it is used with two antithetical
nominatives, e. g. 42. 6 Ego te poetri, Messalla antem anaqaan'e's cre'rne'rea-
’ bernar. ln other writers, the verb naturally follows the number of the
second nominative. Cp. He'st ii. 30,14 Caesena ul sadum ec macn-
losum, elle nt menalium ac nanum carentem: so censuere, Ann. i. 8, 145
