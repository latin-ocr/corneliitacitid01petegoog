lxxxviii INTRODUCTION.

the use 01 pronouns (1111 . . . iste, 111. . . is) which distinguish the two
1011111100 01 MSS. Scheuer (after Binde) has reckoned that both agree
thirty-one times 111 showing ille, and ten times in rite3 there remain
twenty places where X gives t'steand Y 211¹. Michaelis generally adhered‚
in his critical edition, to AB and rite, but was forced to accept sileat

30. 01 (where the pronoun is thrice repeated, per anaphoram), while at
6.7 he takes ipsos from E, with all editors. Binde, who gives an

exhaustive treatment 01 the subject 111 1110 second chapter 01 his disserta·
tion, thought that in the Y class iste had been deleted ‘ubi nudum, ubi
ante suum nomen, ubi post primum adiectivum, si substantivo apponuntur
duo adiectiva, positum erat'; but Scheuer rightly doubts how a copyist .
could have arrived at such a ‘law,' and quotes against it the instances at·
23. 7 ; 41. 203 26. 6 (where there is 0 general agreement 1011111111 the
MSS.).

It seems certain that AB cannot be invariably right, while on the other
band theY class cannot be followed in all cases. All editors agree in
altering isti (the reading 01 011 the codd.) to illi at 41. 203 011 the other
hand there is no dubiety about librum ritum 3. 63 tragoediae 111013. 15;
comitatus r'stos 11. 13. As in other textual difficulties an eclectio method
must be pursued in deciding between X and Y where they disagree3 101
instance, 1 accept ista 110111 ΑΒ at 19. 4, and, with equal probability,
1110101 10. 03, 11111 reject it at 12. 16. Other passages 101 comparison
are 13. 33 13.19; 21. 283 24. 1²3 and 25.5 where theY class
gives 11100 and the Χο1000 111017 12. οο ; 13.1;16.5;18.7;23.2;
and 33. 00 where Y=tllud, and X=1itud; 9. ²03 12. 83 13. 19 ;
14173 20.4; 30.04; 01111 31. 15 where Y=2tla and X=rila; 49
and 23. 13 where Y=rilam and X=zitam5 19. 9 where Y=ille and X:
1111.

Α similar difficulty arises (as frequently in other MSS) about the use
01 111 and his. Examples are: his most codd, iis B; 30. 16 iis AB, his
EV‚CAH, 11111) (as again at 11. 6); 34. 34 iis ABCAH, 110 EV„ Is D
(cp. 31. 4); 42. 5 iis ABC, 111 EV,DH ; 14. 18 iis ABCAD, his EV2H3
24. 8 a‘sABcaD‚12·sEV,H: ep. 25. 9 11111111 ABcaDH, haidem Ev, ;

35. 13 111 ΑΒΕᾙ), iis CA; 37. 9 his ABEV,1)H, 111 CA. The prefer·
enee of C for 111 may be noted in the last two places: cp. 5. 0 iis CAD,

his ABEV,H; 8. 01 111 CAD, Iris ΑΕ112 [111] Β, om. H. and edd. vet

1111010 can be little doubt that this bility 01 11110 nterpretatronrsevrdent from
must bedae to the similarity oscam, the occurrence (Dial. 1417) 0111111111
pendia. Itis remarkable, 00 Bin de has CAD sorella EVH t'rtaAB‘- =:r‘tt) while

in the Su 0101111ιο fragment nd onlyo nce at 19. 4D actually 01101101 asor illa Y,
in the Germama (x. 17); but the pr roba· istaX.
