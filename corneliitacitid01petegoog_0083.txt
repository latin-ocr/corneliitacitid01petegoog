arbitrary and irresponsible emendation, enabled him to produce a text
which presents many points of contrast to that of Michaelis. Binde, in
a dissertation to which reference will be made again (1884), supported
the wiew of Michaelis, with variatione. The latest contribution to the
criticism of the Dciilogue bas been made by F. Scheuer (1891), who, in
apamphlet to which all future editors will continue to be indebted,
endeavours to establish the superiority of the Y family, though on other
grounds than those on which Baehrens had relied.

Before proceeding to a more detailed consideration of the subject of
the distinguisbing characteristics of the two families, it will be advisable
to fumish here a more specific account of the various codices to which
reference has already been made,

Of Vaticanus 1862 (A), nothing need be said in addition to what has
already been stated, except that the order of its contents is (ι) the
Germanic, (a) the fragment of Suetonius, and (3) the Dialogus. It
was doubtless a faithful copy of the manuscript from which it was
transcribed.

The Leidensis (B), on the other hand, in which the Dialogus comes
first and is followed by the Germania and the Suetonius, presents several
points os interest and peculiarity. It was long supposed to be the
actual copy made from Enoch's codex by Jovianus Pontanus, the intimate
associate ol Alfonso the Magnanimous, who played a large part in the
literary society of the Naples of his day ¹. It is now admitted, however,
that B is not the original apographon of Fontanus, but a copy of it. It
differs considerably from A, though it is impossible now to say how far
thedifference is attributable to the changes introduced by Pontanus him·
self, and how far to the copyist of B. Pontanus is known to have been an
elegant and accurate scholar, and he no doubt incorporated many emen·
dations in the text as he transcribed it. Moreover, the scribe sometimes
makes corrections in his own hand, some of which are right, while others
are wrong ². Lastly, the whole was subsequently revised by another hand,
cited as b, the author of which is generally supposed to have had other
