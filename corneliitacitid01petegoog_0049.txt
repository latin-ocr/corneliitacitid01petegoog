the piece. In regard to this point, the interpretation of ch. 1. 11 (curn
singuli deantes quedem sed probabiles causas adferrent, dun [sirmam sui
quisquerat anantes engenii redderent) is of the greatest importance. To
exclude Secundus from the reference here, would be to practically limit
it to Messalla and Maternus: on the strictest interpretation of delusas
causas adferre—occardng as this phrase does aiter eandem lanc quaes·

it is not his province to suggest any causae for a decline which he does
not admit ¹. Again, if the lacuna really extends over about one-ninth
of the whole treatise², itis difficolt to imagine what it can have con-¹
tained except on the theory that Secundus also spoke³. Messalla cannot
have gone on much longer. His subject had been prescribed for him
by Maternus in ch. 33. 8 queuis exercitationibus euuems eam el sorum

elaborated the criticism of contemporary methods with which his speech
breaks off, that subiect may be said to have been overtaken before the
lacuna occurs. On the other hand, it is argued that it is more con·
sistent with what we know of the retiring and unwarlike⁴ disposition
of Secundus to conceive him as confining himself to assisting the progress
of the action by appropriate interpellations: also that no reference is
made to him in the closing chapter, where Maternus, Messalla, and Aper
bring the discussion to a close. The theory that we actually have part
oia speech by Secundus in what follows after the lacuna, will be better
dealt with in connexion with Maternus.

l The fourth and lest of the interlocutors in the Dialogus, Curiatius
