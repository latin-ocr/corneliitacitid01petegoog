THE INTERLOCUTORS ΛΝΒ THEIR PARTS. xxxvii

which is given in the same chapter to bis two visitors, Aper andJ(
Secundus. His tragedies are made the occasion of the discussion which
forms the first part of the treatise3 and it is certain—no matter what
theory of the arrangement of parts may be adopted-that it was he who
contributed the closing speech <42 Finierat Maternus). Itis he also
who'guides and controls the development of the discussion, speakingin
ch. 16 for Secundus as well as for himself, bringing out the real points

at issue in ch 24, recalling Messalla to it in ch 2⁷, and prevailing
on him to continue his speech in ch. 33. As one who hasbeen both

a poet and a pleader, he is well qualified to decide between the rival
attractione of the two professious. Already under Nero (11. 9) he had
distinguished himself by writing 3 tragedy, which seems not to have
been without some practical result ; and another tragedy—the ‘Cato ’-
was now the topic of general conversation at Rome. But his resolution
has been taken. He intends to forsake the profession of advocate (ac
tam me derangere a forensi labore constitui, 11. ra) aud to devote himself
wholly to the pursuit of poetry. Nothing that Aper can urge will shake
him from his purpose. How long he lived to give effect to it is 3 matter ‚ ’
of uncertainty. A passage from Dio Cassius¹ has been quoted by many
critics as proving that he lived till 91 t. n, when he was put to death by
Domitian for undue frecdom of speech. But Maternus was a common
name in imperial times, and the reference may be to another person
altogether. If hc had been the Maternus of the Dablogm, it is unlikely
that he 'would have been designated a ‘sophist,’ and as practising
declamation, so long after he had resigned the profession of advocate

in favour of poetry. The argument, however, has served to increase „f
the difficulty as to Maternus's personality‚ and to complicate the question

of the Tacitean authorship of the treatise. It has been contended² that
Tacitus would not have ventured‚ in the reign of Domitian aud during

' the lifetime of Maternus, to attribute to the latter sentimeuts which seem,
at times, almost to anticipate the fate tbat is said to have afterwards
overtaken him. Itis just as probable‚ however, that the Maternus of
the Dz'alogue had died (like the otherinterloeutors) in the interval between
an. 74-75 and the date at which the treatise was composed. A reference

to this (and not to the fate of the other Maternus, the σοφιστῆς) may
perhaps he detected in the end of ch. 13, where the speaker dwells on

the thought of death with an inspired prevision which the writer may have
wished to indicate had been only too well founded. And many difficulties
as to the general tendency of Matemus’s utterances, and consequently
