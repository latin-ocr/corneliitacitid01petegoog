On the other hand, the following differences may be noted, caused by
significant omissions in H :—

The following 212 interesting examples 01 those transpositions (repro-
duced 111 22119 2111110112) which frequently occur in manuscripts, especially
where the collocation is a familiar one (cp. note on velut quadam,
5. 23):—

For the rest, it is noticeable that H, while in general agreement with
the Y family, shares with Da leaning to AB, especially the former. In
the places cited by Scheuer on pp. 29, 30, where ABD differ 110111
EV2CA, H is generally in agreement with ABD. On the whole, the
study ο1 112 ρ2211112111122 eonfirms the impression that neither 01 the two
families is to be blindly followed, and that the restoration 01 the true
text must be secured by an eclectio method. The divergenees already
tabulated may suggest to some a theory that there 11129 have been more
than one archetype, and that Enoch’s codex is not the only 0112 110111
which the text has been derived. But the strongest possible proof of the
' common origin 01 all existing MSS. is fumished hythe occurrence in 211
01 1112111 01 the lacuna noted in the text at the end of ch. 35. Some have
thought thatthe portion of the treatise here omitted is of no veryconsiderable
extent, and may even have consisted of only a few lines3 but 211 the
