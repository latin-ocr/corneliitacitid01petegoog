xx INTRODUCTION.

With the theory that the Dablogue was written by Tacitus when about
thirty years of age, and that the conversation at which he professes to have
been present took place some ten years previously, the internal evidence
offered by the treatise harmonizes very well. We shall find that the
style is as Ciceronian as was possible for a writer living towards the end
of the first century: a natural phenomenon in the case of one who had
begun his career as an orator ¹, and who was embodying in this treatsie
the fruits of his early rhetorical and literary studies. The later style of
Tacitus is very different, but it would have been out of place in such
a work as this, even if we could suppose that he had already developed it
at the time when the Dialogus appears to have been written. Then he
no doubt shared in that reaction against Seneca of which Quintilian
made himself the chief exponent-some of the features of the philo·
sopher's style and mode of thought being exemplified in the person of
Aper, for criticism by others with whom Tacitus had more literary and
personal sympathy: afterwards the bitter experienee of public affairs at
Rome and the iron pressure of a cruel despotism led him to adopt,
in dealing with altogether different subject matter, the concentrated
vigour of the tersa, pithy, and pointed style for which his name now
stands as a synonym. Those who question his authorship of the
Dz'alogue, on the ground of difference of style, base their case on reasons
which would lead them also, as Mr. Simcox says, to ‘doubt the genuine·
ness of Mt. Carlyle's early essays in the Edzizburgh Reuz'cw if he had not
collected them himself! While Cicero is undoubtedly Tacitus’s model
in the De'alogue, the treatise contains clear traces of the writer's own
individuality, besides unmistakeable coincidences‚ as regards words and
phrases, with the usage of the historical books ². There isa considerable
correspondence also between the criticisms pronounced on Roman
orators and others in the Dablogue, and what Tacitus says about the
same individuals elsewhere: this will be brought out in the notes (e. g.
on 5. 32)³. The eulogy of republican eloquence and of the oratore of
old, in ch. 36, may be compared with the speech put into the mouth
of C. Silius when advocating the enforcement of the lex Caiatia (Ann.
xi. 6): and one of his sentences (putcherrzmam alzbqus'n et bonarum
arleium przitct'pem cordedie mahaitert'as foedare) reminds the reader of
another famous passage in the Dzblogue (32. 18) ut quae elain omarum
