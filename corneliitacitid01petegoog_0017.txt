the Dialogus with the best works oi its kind, as a genuine monument of
classical antiquity. At first he thought that he had discovered init Quin·
tilian's lost treatise, De causti corruptae eloquentiae¹5 and accordingly
the title under which the work appeared in his original Antwerp edition
was ‘Fau Qar'rrlilram', ut vedetur, Dialogus aa rur' saeculi oratores et quare
concedant .· Corneto Tacito salso inscriptus! But as Quintilian was born
about 35 an, he could hardly have described himself as being still
rauenir admodum (Dral. l. ra) in 74-75 nn, the year in which the conver-
sation out ol which the Dr'alogm resulted is generally understood to have
taken place. , This consideration was in itseli enough to shake, even in
his own mind, the view to which Lipsius had given a perhaps too hasty
expressiou3 aud so in subsequent issues oi his work Taa‘to augo
suscriptas takes the place of Tacito salso r'rtrcrr'ptar, while in his third
(Leyden) edition of 1585, he states his doubts about Quintilian, though still
convinced of the difficulties in the way oi the traditional view. Lipsius's
final attitude was, in lact, that which is adopted by more than one critic
oi the present day-a iudicial Non liquet

But though he expressly disclaimed any wish to impose his own
opinions on his contemporaries or successors (mail alri's praeeo quod
sequantur), the authority oi his great name sufficed to induce a general
suspension ofjudgement during the two centuries which succeeded his
epoch. Some scholars adhered to the Tacitean tradition, others advocated
Quintilian²z some took a new departure, ascribing the Dralogac to the
younger Pliny, or to Suetonius, or to the poet-pleader who is its central
figure, Curiatius Maternus. But Pliny could only have been thirteen
years oi age when he is supposed to have been present at the conversa-
tion reported in the treatise: Suetonius is chronologically still more
’ impossible: while the theory about Maternus is altogether inconsistent
with the ‘setting’ oi the Dialogae, which purports to be written by one
who, so lar irorn taking a leading part in the conversation narrated, had
been merely a listener to the views oi others ⁸. The saiest position was
