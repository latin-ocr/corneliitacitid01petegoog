MANUSCRIPTS. lxiii

probability is that we owe the minor works‚ not to Poggio, but to a Pope
who was also an eamest scholar, and practically the founder of the
Vatican Library at Rome. In the year 1451, Nicholas V had sent the
monk Enoch of Ascoli, formerly one of his most intimate associatos,
into France, Gemrany, and Denmark, to search for manuscripts and to
take copies. There is still extant a letter in which he recommends his
emissary to the good offices of Ludwig of Erlichshausen. After referring
to his intention of making a collection of Greek and Latin MSS, worthy

of the Supreme Pontiff and the Apostolic See, Pope Nicholas specifies
the motive of Enoch’s mission in the following passage: sed eum multi

libri ex antiquis deficiant, qui culpa superebrum temporum sunt deperditi, od
inquirendum et transcribendum si repertantur eiusmodi libros¹ mittemus
delectum filiurn Enoch Esculonnm utrum, doctum grecis et· lote'riei lettere's,
fiemiliorem nostrum, qui diuersa loca et monasterio enouirat, si que's ex ipsis
deperditis opud uos libris reperiretur. Idcirco nostri contemplatione uelis
omnes tui territorii libros sebi ostendere, antiquos presertim et prisce scrip·
ture, et sz'mul permittere ut in tuo terretorio scribi possit expensis nostres.
Nolumus enim ut aliquis leber surripiatur, sed tantummodo ut fiat copia
transcribendi super quibus ipse Enoch tecum loquetur lateus ex parte
nostro ².

At first, Enoch does not seem to have fulfilled the high expectations y “

that had been formed of the prospects of his mission. Poggio, in
particulas, appears to have had a poor idea of his qualifications. Enoch
had been a pupil of Filelso, with whom Poggio had interchanged such
courtesies as were common among the scholars of that day ; and he was
undertaking a task in which Poggio himself had already been more than
once disappointed, notahly in an effort to procure a complete copy of
Livy which he had been told was to be 'found in a Cistercian monastery
near Lobeck. ln a letter addressed to Fr. Coppino‚ Poggio says that, in
two years, Enoch had found nothing that even an uneducated person
would find it worth his while to read ⁹. Porphyrio's commentary on
Horace and Apicius seem to have been the chief results of Enoch’s early
efforts. But the air was full of the rumour of new discoveries. The
times were favourahle, and such a mission as Enoch's was not likely to
provea failure in the end. We know from Poggio's letters to Niccolo
Niccoli⁸ (1425-28) that he had himself formerly been on the track of some
