It was an examination of the neglected Vindobonenrai· occxr (V,) that
led Scheuer to his conclusions. He found that it is nearly ahin to E,
and almost in exact agreement with it where E shows the readings of X
instead of those of its own class Y. Both therefore derive from a common
source, which must have been a truer representative of Y than that to
which CAD are to be traced. The supposition that either codex was
copied from the other is excluded by a list of variants in which each
shows individual peculiarities of its own. Instead of E having been
corrected from A or B, the opposite is the case. E is sometimes in
agreement with AB, orwith B alone, where V, does not follow it, and
we may therefore infer that their original (γι) had been corrected after V,
was copied from it. In this emended state it was probably used by
Pontanus, or by both Pontanus and the copyist of B. Scheuer next
proves the common origin os CAD, which had already been partly
established by Binde ¹. Their source he designatas γ’, and infers that its
disagreement with ABEV, must be attributed to caprice or carelessness
on the part of the copyist, while the textos the lost archetype Y' may be
restored by the agreement of y¹ with Α and B. The fact that D often
forsakes its own class to agree with A and B, where its kindred EV, and
CA are in disagreement, Scheuer explains by supposing for D (or rather
forits original, as Baehrens had suggested) what Michaelis bad asserted

for E, namely, correction out of the X family. In proof of this the
following places are quoted where D has been ‘contaminated' from X
and Y: 30. a vocantis D, vocatis X, vocant Y; 4l.3 quis anthr quedem
quod nemo D, qm'dcm quod nemo A, quir entire Y ; 37. 19 est habendus D,
habendus est X, habendus Y.

Some oi Scheuer's conclusione rest no doubt on a superstructure of

hypothesis, but his general theory marks an advance on the work of pre· ,
vious critics. It seems to me, however, that future speculation as to the
inter-relationship of the various codices will have to take account oi the
hitherto neglected Harlerbnus, which is certainly of great importance for
the'history of the constitution of the text. Inow proceed to report the
result of my examination of this interesting manuscript. Its official
description is as follows: Brit. Mus. Harley 2639, vellum, 8 ><5ff inches ;
ff. 43, fifteenth century. 'Contains ‘Suetonii tranquilli de grammaticis et

rhetoribus libri duo,' ff. 2-14 v.: ‘C. Cornelii Taciti Dialogus de Oratori- .

bus Claris,’ if. 15-42 v. On the first folio the name of its last owner is
written ‘Ambrosii Bonvici, 1687! This was Ambrose Bonvicke (1652-
1722), scholar of St. John's College, Oxford, in 1669, Librarian in 1670,
