d found wanting in the moderatiori and seli-restraint that are called for
under existing conditions, It is here that we must look for the recon-

and how far it is the product ol the writer's imagination. There can be
no doubt, however, that it rests on a certain basis os lact. The dramatis

meet the charges that have been made against the construction oi the
treatise, against its unity oi plan and purpose, by taking refuge in the
argument that itis simplya narrative, as accurate as the writer’s recollec-
