lxxii INTRODUCTION.

de veros illustrabas, and (a) the Agricola, (b) the Dialogue, and (c) the
Germania, loc.

The ottobonianus (E) is a late codex (fifteenth or sixteenth century)
with very miscellaneous contents. After Messalae Coruini de progenie sua
libellos comes (a) the Suetonius fragment, and (b) the Dialogae, followed
by many tractates, too various to mention. The importance of this
codex was first recognized by Michaelis, but it was taken for a copy of
the Farnesionus (C) corrected from Α. This theory was disproved by
Steuding¹‚ who erred, however, in attributing CE and Δ to a common
source.

Next to E may be placed the thobonensis occxr (νὴ, whose kinship
with the ottobonianus has been clearly demonstrated by Scheuer, and
whose contents are equally miscellaneous. At the close of the sen'es
comes (a) the Germania, followed by (b) the Dialogue, and (c) the
Suetonius. This codex bears date nn. 1466. It has been designated V,
to distinguish it from another Vienna manuscript, viz.-

Vindobonensis cecat (V). This codex bears the arms os Matthias
Corvinus, King of Hungary, for whom it was probably written. It after-
wards belonged to Joannes Samhucns (1563). It contains the last six
books of the Aureolo, the Historias, and (a) the Germania, (b) the
Dialogae, where the addition to the title, in a later hand, of the name

¹ of Quintilian helped to forward the theory that the Dialogue was really
the composition os the great teacher of rhetoric. For the historical
books, it is in close agreement with the codex from which Spita must
have printed his edz'tio princeps: see Wissowa, Lectiones Tacitenae, spect-

men Tertium, 1832. So sar aa the Dialogues concemed, it was
probably copied, carelessly enough, from a codex closely related to the
Harlaanus (H), the account os which may be postponed to p. lxxv¹.

The divergence between the two families will be made evident by a
consideration of the following places :-
