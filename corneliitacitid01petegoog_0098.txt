Probability is strongly in favour also ol :-

Here are two cases of transposition, in regard to which the superiority
of the Y reading is argued in the notes :—

EV2CADH AB
22. 4 eiusdem aetatr's aratores aratores eiusdem aerata
22. 7 senior inm¹ · iam senior
Cp. also 30. 20 ingenuae artas artis ingenuae

It is probably the superior knowledge of the copyist that is de·

23. 1 ius namnum EV2CADH as against ins vetn'num AB

5.6 Saleium V2CADH‚SeleiumE ,‚ Salerum A, dalerr'nB

9. 9 Saleium EV2CAH, Saltium D „ Caeleium A, Coeleium B

When we come to examine the places where the conect reading seems
to have depended on the copyist’s ability to interpret compendia and
terminal abbreviatione we find a very considerable advantage on the
side of theY family. It should be remembered‚ however, that this is
in itself no proos of the superiority os Y over X. The following is a list
os the readings which are rightly given by the descendants ol Y :-

2. 14 amni ΕΜΔ cu ABDH
5.15 necessitudines EV2CAD necessitates AB (nationes H, edd. vett.)
5. 25 ΜΨ) EV2C AD profugia AB (praesidio H, edd. vett.)

¹ Gudeman supports the reading ol the to combine with et, ac, nt, nan, nisi, si,

observing that iam has a decided tendency 8. ης 92. 303 89. 6, are not to the point.
