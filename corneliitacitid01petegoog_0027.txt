xiv INTRODUCTION.

reading of the MSS.: (ι) sex et quinquaginta, with Lipsius; (a) εφ-
tirnarn . . . statianum, with Ulrichs; and (3) ceumm ef undeurgrnii(cx1x
for cxx). On the whole, however, Ι prefer to hold fast to sextam
statianam: and taking it as theone fixed and certain factor in the
calculatori, accept the year sm. 74-75 as the date wanted, altering the
other figures to correspond. This involves the acceptance of Lipsius’s
’ sex et quinquaginta. If we suppose, further, thatin hunc daim is to
be pressed, as indicating that the company had met on or about the
anniversary of Cicero’s death, ie. in December 74 ¹, we shall be tempted
to make an additional change from centurn et urgenti to centurn et
sedecim (cxx-cxvi). Everything will in this way come out square, and
in accordance with the known facts of history. The constituent factors
are enumerated separately and approximately‚ and then Aper does the
rapid calculation, which gives exactly 116 years (s. υ. c. 'yn-827) as
the correct interval between December 43 uc. and December, un. 74.
In favour of the end of the year un. 74 as the date of the meeting
made famous in the Dsalagru, a certain amount of additional evidence is
derived from various allusions in the body of the treatise itself. Thus at
17. aa reference is made to the last largess which had been given to the
people (praxinus quriiem congiaria ipsi uidistis plerasque senes, uc.) as
something within recent memory: it is known to have been given by
Titus in 73. Again in 37. 1 Mucianus is spoken of as alive and at
work over a collection of speeches belonging to the republican period.
Now from a passage in Pliny (N. H. xxxii. 6, 62), in which he is referred
to in the past tense, it has been argued, with great probability that in
an. 77-the year in which Pliny presented his Natural Histary to Titus
-Mucianus was no longer alive (see Teuffel-Schwabe, §§ 313-4). This
would seem at least to narrow the range of choice to one of the years
preceding that date—as an upper limit. For the lower limit, mention ’
may be made of the use of nuper² at 5. 30, referring to an appearance
made by Eprius Marcellus before the senate, probably in the year nn. 70.
Another reference to the same individual, along with Vibius Crispus,
points more definitely to the year 74 itself: nunc principes iu Caesaris
amicitia agunt feruntque cuncta (8. 18). Eprius had been away in
Asia from 71 to 73, doing duty as proconsul: he was consul sufflatus
